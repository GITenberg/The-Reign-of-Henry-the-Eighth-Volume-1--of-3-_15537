<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

  <p>James Anthony Froude was born at Dartington Rectory, the youngest son
  of the Archdeacon of Totnes, on April 23, 1818. His father was a
  clergyman of the old school, as much squire as parson. In the concluding
  chapter to his <i>History of England</i>, Froude wrote that "for a
  hundred and forty years after the Revolution of 1688, the Church of
  England was able to fulfil with moderate success the wholesome functions
  of a religious establishment. Theological doctrinalism passed out of
  fashion; and the clergy, merged as they were in the body of the nation,
  and no longer endeavouring to elevate themselves into a separate order,
  were occupied healthily in impressing on their congregations the meaning
  of duty and moral responsibility to God." Of this sane and orthodox, but
  not over-spiritual, clergy, Archdeacon Froude was an excellent and
  altogether wholesome type. He was a stiff Tory; his hatred of Dissent was
  so uncompromising that he would not have a copy of the <i>Pilgrim's
  Progress</i> in the rectory. A stern, self-contained, reticent man, he
  never, in word of deed, confessed his affection for his youngest son. He
  was a good horseman, and was passionately fond of open-air exercises and
  especially of hunting. His one accomplishment was drawing, and his
  sketches in after years earned the praise of Ruskin.</p>

  <p>Cast in the same mould, but fashioned by different circumstances, the
  archdeacon's eldest son, Richard Hurrell Froude, was a man of greater
  intellectual brilliance and even more masterful character. He was one of
  the pioneers of the Oxford Movement, and it was only his early death that
  deposed him from his place of equality with Newman and Keble and Pusey.
  Anthony was a sickly child, and from his earliest years lacked the loving
  care of a mother. He was brought up with Spartan severity by his father
  and his aunt. The most venial self-indulgence was regarded as criminal.
  From the age of three he was inured to hardship by being ducked every
  morning in a trough of ice-cold water. Hurrell Froude felt no tenderness
  for the ailing lad. Once, in order to rouse a manly spirit in his little
  brother, he took him by the heels, plunged him like another Achilles into
  a stream, and <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>[viii]</span> stirred with his head the mud at the
  bottom. Froude has been accused, and not without justice, of not feeling
  a proper aversion to acts of cruelty. The horrible Boiling Act of Henry
  VIII. excites neither disgust nor hatred in him; and he makes smooth
  excuses for the illegal tortures of the rack and the screw which were
  inflicted on prisoners by Elizabeth and her ministers. He had himself
  been reared in a hardy school; he had been trained to be indifferent to
  pain. It may well be that his callousness in speaking of Tudor cruelties
  is to be traced to the influences that surrounded his loveless childhood
  and youth.</p>

  <p>Hurrell Froude was the idol of his younger brothers. He was a man of
  brilliant parts, and a born leader of men. His hatred of Radicals and
  Dissenters transcended even his father's dislike of them. His conception
  of the Church differed widely from that in which the archdeacon had been
  reared. To him a clergyman was a priest who belonged to a sacerdotal
  caste, and who ought not "to merge himself in the body of the nation." To
  him the Reformation was an infamous crime, and Henry VIII. was worse than
  the Bluebeard of the nursery. His hero was Thomas à Becket. He wrote a
  sketch of his life and career, which he did not live to finish. His
  friends ill-advisedly published it after his death. His ideal
  ecclesiastical statesman of modern times was Archbishop Laud. Charles I.
  was a martyr, and the Revolution of 1688 an inglorious blunder. To the
  day of his death&mdash;in spite of the harsh discipline which he received
  at his hands in boyhood, in spite of wide divergence of opinion in later
  years in all matters secular and religious&mdash;Froude never ceased to
  worship at his brother's shrine. Out of regard for his memory, more than
  from any passionate personal conviction, he associated himself while at
  Oxford with the Anglican movement. His affectionate admiration for
  Newman, neither time nor change served to impair. If Carlyle was his
  prophet in later years, his influence happily did not affect his style.
  That was based on the chaste model of Newman. He owed his early
  friendship with Newman to that great man's association with Hurrell
  Froude. Many years after, when Freeman had venomously accused him of
  "dealing stabs in the dark at a brother's almost forgotten
  fame"&mdash;poor Froude's offence was that he dared to write an essay on
  Thomas à Becket&mdash;he defended himself with rare emotion against the
  charge. "I look back upon my brother," he said, "as on the whole <!--
  Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix"></a>[ix]</span> the
  most remarkable man I have ever met in my life. I have never seen any
  person&mdash;not one&mdash;in whom, as I now think him, the excellences
  of intellect and character were combined in fuller measure."</p>

  <p>As Froude's powers developed and matured, and as his experience of the
  world broadened, he cast away his brother's yoke, and reverted more to
  his father's school of thought. As his father was to him the ideal
  clergyman of the Church of England, so the Church before 1828 remained to
  him the model of what an established religion should be. He was a
  thorough Erastian, who believed in the subordination of the Church to the
  state. He detested theological doctrinalism of all kinds; he revolted
  against the idea that the clergy should form a separate order. The
  pretensions of Whitgift and Laud, the High Anglican school of Keble and
  Pusey, the whole conception of the Church and the priesthood which
  underlay the Oxford Movement, were things obnoxious to him. In a
  characteristic passage in the chapter on the Massacre of St. Bartholomew
  he reveals his hatred and distrust of dogmatism. "Whenever the doctrinal
  aspect of Christianity has been prominent above the practical," he wrote,
  "whenever the first duty of the believer has been held to consist in
  holding particular opinions on the functions and nature of his Master,
  and only the second in obeying his Master's commands, then always, with a
  uniformity more remarkable than is obtained in any other historical
  phenomena, there have followed dissension, animosity, and in later ages
  bloodshed. Christianity, as a principle of life, has been the most
  powerful check upon the passions of mankind. Christianity as a
  speculative system of opinion has converted them into monsters of
  cruelty."</p>

  <p>Holding such decided views on doctrinalism, it might have been thought
  that Froude would have visited all the warring sects of the sixteenth
  century with equal judgment. No Church was more doctrinal than that of
  Geneva; no Calvinist ever was more dogmatic than John Knox. But the men
  who fought the battle of the Reformation in England and Scotland were, in
  the main, the Calvinists; and to Froude the Reformation was the beginning
  of a new and better era, when the yoke of the priest had been finally
  cast away. "Calvinism," he said in one of his addresses at St. Andrews,
  "was the spirit which rises in revolt against untruth." John Knox was too
  heroic a figure not to rouse the artistic sense in <!-- Page x --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"></a>[x]</span> Froude. "There lies one,"
  said the Regent Morton over his coffin, "who never feared the face of
  mortal man." Froude has made this epitaph the text of the noblest eulogy
  ever delivered on Knox. "No grander figure can be found, in the entire
  history of the Reformation in this island, than that of Knox." He
  surpassed Cromwell and Burghley in integrity of purpose and in purity of
  methods. He towered above the Regent Murray in intellect, and he worked
  on a larger scale than Latimer. "His was the voice that taught the
  peasant of the Lothians that he was a free man, the equal in the sight of
  God with the proudest peer or prelate that had trampled on his
  forefathers. He was the one antagonist whom Mary Stuart could not soften
  nor Maitland deceive. He it was who had raised the poor commons of his
  country into a stern and rugged people, who might be hard, narrow,
  superstitious, and fanatical, but who nevertheless were men whom neither
  king, noble, nor priest could force again to submit to tyranny." Yet even
  here, Froude could not refrain from quoting the sardonic comment of the
  English ambassador at Edinburgh: Knox behaved, said Randolph, "as though
  he were of God's privy council."</p>

  <p>It is certain, at least, that other reformers, who were not greatly
  inferior to Knox in capacity, and not at all in piety and honesty, have
  not met the same generous treatment at his hands. He sneers at Hooper
  because he had scruples about wearing episcopal robes at his consecration
  as Bishop of Worcester, though he himself in a famous passage asserts the
  anomalous position of bishops in the Church of England. Hooper, as a
  Calvinist, was in the right in objecting, and though the point upon which
  he took his stand was nominally one of form, there lay behind it a
  protest against the Anglican conception of a bishop. He speaks
  slightingly of Ridley and Ferrars, though he makes ample amends to them
  and to Hooper, when he comes to describe the manner of their death. To
  the reformers who fled from the Marian persecution, including men like
  Jewel and Grindal, he refers with scornful contempt, though he has no
  word of criticism to apply to Knox for retiring to England and to the
  continent when the flame of persecution was certainly not more fierce.
  Latimer is one of his favourites,&mdash;a plain, practical man, not given
  to abstract speculation or theological subtleties, but one who was
  content to do his duty day by day without the fear of man before his
  eyes. Latimer, though he was looked upon <!-- Page xi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi"></a>[xi]</span> as a Protestant in the
  earliest years of the English Reformation, believed in the Real Presence
  up to a short time before his death. But of all English ecclesiastics
  Thomas Cranmer was perhaps most to Froude's liking. Cranmer was, like
  Froude himself, an artist in words. The English liturgy owes its charm
  and beauty to his sense of style, his grace of expression, and his
  cultured piety. That he was a great man few will be found in these days
  to maintain; fewer still will believe that he deserved the scathing
  invective of Macaulay. But no one can read the account given by Froude of
  his last years without feeling that the first Protestant Archbishop of
  Canterbury was neither saint nor martyr. If ever there was one, he was a
  timeserver. He pronounced the divorce of Catherine of Arragon, though he
  had sworn fealty to the Pope. He never raised a protest against any of
  the political murders of Henry VIII.&mdash;with the notable exception of
  his courageous attempt to save his friend, Thomas Cromwell. Even in that
  case, however, he lies under the suspicion of having interfered through
  fear that his own fate was involved in that of the <i>malleus
  monachorum</i>. In the days of Edward VI. he aimed at the liberty, if not
  at the life, of Bonner and Gardiner, without semblance of legal right: He
  recanted in the reign of Mary when he thought he could purchase his
  miserable life. It was only when all hope of pardon was past that he
  re-affirmed his belief in the reformed faith. Indeed, he waited until the
  day of his execution before withdrawing his recantation, and confounded
  his enemies on the way to the stake. To a master of dramatic narrative
  the last scene of Cranmer's life came as a relief and an inspiration. "So
  perished Cranmer," wrote Froude, in a memorable passage: "he was brought
  out, with the eyes of his soul blinded, to make sport for his enemies,
  and in his death he brought upon them a wider destruction than he had
  effected by his teaching while alive. Pole was appointed the next day to
  the See of Canterbury; but in other respects the court had over-reached
  themselves by their cruelty. Had they been contented to accept the
  recantation, they would have left the archbishop to die broken-hearted,
  pointed at by the finger of pitying scorn; and the Reformation would have
  been disgraced in its champion. They were tempted, by an evil spirit of
  revenge, into an act unsanctioned even by their own bloody laws; and they
  gave him an opportunity of writing his name in the roll of martyrs. The
  worth of a man must be <!-- Page xii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexii"></a>[xii]</span> measured by his life, not by his failure
  under a single and peculiar peril. The Apostle, though forewarned, denied
  his Master on the first alarm of danger; yet that Master, who knew his
  nature in its strength and its infirmity, chose him for the rock on which
  he would build his Church."</p>

  <p>With this conscious and avowed bias in favour of undogmatic
  Christianity, Froude came to write the story of the transition of England
  from a Catholic to a Protestant country. He was not without sympathy with
  the old order of things. We cannot but feel a thrill as we read his
  incomparable description of the change which was effected in men's
  thoughts and ideas by the translation of the mediæval into the modern
  world? "For, indeed, a change was coming upon the world, the meaning and
  direction of which even still is hidden from us, a change from era to
  era. The paths trodden by the footsteps of ages were broken up; old
  things were passing away, and the faith and the life of ten centuries
  were dissolving like a dream. Chivalry was dying; the abbey and the
  castle were soon together to crumble into ruins; and all the forms,
  desires, beliefs, convictions, of the old world were passing away, never
  to return. A new continent had risen up beyond the western sea. The floor
  of heaven, inlaid with stars, had sunk back into an infinite abyss of
  immeasurable space; and the firm earth itself, unfixed from its
  foundations, was seen to be but a small atom in the awful vastness of the
  universe. In the fabric of habit which they had so laboriously built for
  themselves, mankind were to remain no longer. And now it is all
  gone&mdash;like an unsubstantial pageant faded; and between us and the
  old English there lies a gulf of mystery which the prose of the historian
  will never adequately bridge. They cannot come to us, and our imagination
  can but feebly penetrate to them. Only among the aisles of the cathedral,
  only as we gaze upon their silent figures sleeping on their tombs, some
  faint conceptions float before us of what these men were when they were
  alive; and perhaps in the sound of church bells, that peculiar creation
  of mediæval age, which falls upon the ear like the echo of a vanished
  world." Froude was once asked what was the greatest and most essential
  quality of an historian. He replied that it was imagination. It was a
  true and a just saying, and Froude himself possessed the faculty in
  abundance.</p>

  <p>It was not only with the old order that Froude showed his sympathy. He
  is seldom ungenerous in his references to <!-- Page xiii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii"></a>[xiii]</span> individual
  Catholics, however mistaken in his sight their opinions may have been.
  With Wolsey and Warham, Fisher and More, even with Gardiner and Bonner he
  deals fairly and with some amount of real sympathy. The heroic death of
  Campian moves him to pity just as much as the death of Latimer; the
  strenuous labours of Father Parsons to overthrow Elizabeth and
  Protestantism failed to remove him beyond the pale of Froude's charitable
  judgment. One English Catholic alone was reserved for the historian's
  harsh and sometimes petulant criticism. For Cardinal Pole Froude felt the
  angriest contempt. He was descended from the blood royal, both of England
  and of Wales. On his father's side he was descended in direct line from
  the ancient princes of Powis; on his mother's from the Plantagenets and
  the Nevilles. He was the most learned and illustrious Englishman of his
  age. He had stood high in King Henry's favour; he was destined for the
  greatest offices in the state. He was not without natural ambition. Yet
  he forfeited all that he had&mdash;the favour of his prince, the society
  of his mother whom he loved, and the kindred who were proud of him, the
  hope of promotion and of power, his friends, his home, and his country,
  for conscience' sake. He remained true to the ancient faith in which he
  was reared. With unerring instinct he foresaw that, once England was
  severed from the Papacy, it would be impossible for king or parliament to
  stem the flood of the Reformation. For twenty years he remained an exile
  on the continent. He returned an old and broken man, to witness the
  overthrow of his cherished plans. He was repudiated by the Pope whose
  authority he had sacrificed everything to maintain, and in his old age he
  suffered the humiliation of being accused of heresy in the court of Rome.
  He died the same day as Mary died, with the knowledge that all his life's
  labours and sacrifices were come to naught, and that the dominion of the
  Roman Church in England was gone for ever. Froude saw none of the pathos
  or tragedy of Pole's life. To him the cardinal was a renegade, a traitor
  to his country, a mercenary of the Pope, a foreign potentate, a
  "hysterical dreamer," who vainly imagined that he was "the champion of
  heaven, and the destroyer of heresy."</p>

  <p>Froude was, above all, an Englishman. His strongest sympathies went
  out to the "God's Englishmen" of Elizabeth's reign, who broke the power
  of Rome and Spain, and <!-- Page xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexiv"></a>[xiv]</span> who made England supreme in Europe. In
  his first chapter he describes the qualities of Englishmen with a zest
  and gusto that drew the comment from Carlyle that "this seems to me
  exaggerated: what we call John Bullish." He described them as "a sturdy,
  high-hearted race, sound in body and fierce in spirit which, under the
  stimulus of those great shins of beef, their common diet, were the wonder
  of the age." Carlyle's advice when he read this passage in proof was
  characteristic:&mdash;"Modify a little: Frederick the Great was brought
  up on beer-sops; Robert Burns on oatmeal porridge; and Mahomet and the
  Caliphs conquered the world on barley meal." But the passage stood
  unmodified, in spite of Froude's regard for his master.</p>

  <p>How this fierce and turbulent people fought their way to world-wide
  empire was a problem which Froude thought he was able to solve. It was,
  in the main, because they broke down the power of the priests, and
  insisted on the supremacy of state over Church. Therefore all his filial
  affection, his patriotism, and his ecclesiastical prejudices were arrayed
  on the same side. If history be an exact science, then Froude can lay no
  claim to the title of historian. He was a brilliant advocate, a man of
  letters endowed with a matchless style, writing of matters which
  interested him deeply, and in the investigation of which he spent twenty
  years of his life. Froude himself would have been the first to repudiate
  the idea that history is philosophy teaching by examples, or that an
  historian has necessarily a greater insight into the problems of the
  present than any other observant student of affairs. "Gibbon," he once
  wrote, "believed that the era of conquerors was at an end. Had he lived
  out the full life of man, he would have seen Europe at the feet of
  Napoleon. But a few years ago we believed the world had grown too
  civilised for war, and the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park was to be the
  inauguration of a new era. Battles, bloody as Napoleon's, are now the
  familiar tale of every day; and the arts which have made the greatest
  progress are the arts of destruction."</p>

  <p>It is absurd to attack Froude on the ground that he was biassed. No
  man has ever yet written a living history without being biassed.
  Thucydides detested the radicalism of Cleon as heartily as Gibbon hated
  the Christianity of Rome. It was once the fashion of the Oxford school to
  decry Froude as being unworthy of the name of historian. Stubbs, indeed,
  <!-- Page xv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexv"></a>[xv]</span>
  did pay public tribute to Froude's "great work," but he stood almost
  alone of his school. Freeman for many years pursued and persecuted Froude
  with a persistent malevolence which happily has no parallel in the story
  of English scholarship. It is not necessary in this place to do more than
  refer to that unpleasant episode. Since the publication of the brilliant
  vindication of Froude in Mr. Herbert Paul's <i>Life</i>, it would be
  superfluous to go into the details of that unhappy controversy. The only
  difference between Froude and other historians is that Froude's
  partisanship is always obvious. He was not more favourable to Henry VIII.
  than Stubbs was to Thomas à Becket. But Froude openly avowed his
  preferences and his dislikes. Catholicism was to him "a dying
  superstition," Protestantism "a living truth." Freeman went further, and
  charged Froude with having written a history which was not "<i>un livre
  de bonne joy.</i>" It is only necessary to recall the circumstances under
  which the <i>History</i> was written to dispose of that odious charge. In
  order to obtain material for his <i>History</i>, Froude spent years of
  his life in the little Spanish village of Simancas. "I have worked in
  all," he said in his Apologia, "through nine hundred volumes of letters,
  notes, and other papers, private and official, in five languages and in
  different handwritings. I am not rash enough to say that I have never
  misread a word, or overlooked a passage of importance. I profess only to
  have dealt with my materials honestly to the best of my ability." Few,
  indeed, have had to encounter such difficulties as met Froude in his
  exploration of the archives at Simancas. "Often at the end of a page," he
  wrote many years after, "I have felt as after descending a precipice, and
  have wondered how I got down. I had to cut my way through a jungle, for
  no one had opened the road for me. I have been turned into rooms piled to
  the window-sill with bundles of dust-coloured despatches, and told to
  make the best of it. Often have I found the sand glistening on the ink
  where it had been sprinkled when a page was turned. There the letter had
  lain, never looked at again since it was read and put away." Of these
  difficulties not a trace is discoverable in Froude's easy and effortless
  narrative. When he was approaching the completion of his <i>History</i>,
  he vowed that his account of the Armada should be as interesting as a
  novel. He succeeded not only with that portion of his task, but with all
  the stirring story that he set out to narrate. But the ease <!-- Page xvi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvi"></a>[xvi]</span> of his style
  only concealed the real pains which he had taken. Of Freeman's charge
  Froude has long been honourably acquitted. The Simancas MSS. have since
  been published in the Rolls Series, and Mr. Martin Hume, in his
  Introduction, has paid his tribute to the care, accuracy, and good faith
  of their first transcriber. Long before this testimony could be given,
  Scottish historians who disagreed with Froude's conclusions on many
  points,&mdash;men such as Skelton and Burton&mdash;had been profoundly
  impressed with the care, skill, and conscientiousness with which Froude
  handled the mass of tangled materials relating to the history of
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>This does not mean that Froude is free from minor inaccuracies, or
  that he is innocent of graver faults which flowed from his abundant
  quality of imagination. He constantly quotes a sentence inaccurately in
  his text, while it is accurately transcribed in a footnote. He is
  careless in matters which are important to students of Debrett, as for
  instance, he indiscriminately describes Lord Howard as Lord William
  Howard and Lord Howard. But Froude was sometimes guilty of something
  worse than these trivial "howlers." Lecky exposed, with calm
  ruthlessness, some of Froude's exaggerations&mdash;to call them by no
  worse name&mdash;in his <i>Story of the English in Ireland</i>. When his
  <i>Erasmus</i> was translated into Dutch, the countrymen of Erasmus
  accused him of constant, if not deliberate, inaccuracy. Lord Carnarvon
  once sent Froude to South Africa as an informal special commissioner.
  When he returned to this country he wrote an article on the South African
  problem in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. Sir Bartle Frere, who knew South
  Africa as few men did, said of it that it was an "essay in which for
  whole pages a truth expressed in brilliant epigrams alternates with
  mistakes or misstatements which would scarcely be pardoned in a special
  war correspondent hurriedly writing against time." So dangerous is the
  quality of imagination in a writer!</p>

  <p>Truth to tell, Froude was a literary man with a fondness for
  historical investigation, and an artist's passion for the dramatic in
  life and story. He wrote with a purpose&mdash;that purpose being to
  defend the English Reformation against the attacks of the
  neo-Catholic-Anglicans, under whose influence he had himself been for a
  time in his youth. To him, therefore, Henry VIII. was "the majestic lord
  who broke the bonds of Rome." This is not the occasion, nor is the
  present writer the man, to analyse that complex and masterful <!-- Page
  xvii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
  personality. Froude started to defend the English Reformation against the
  vile charge that it was the outcome of kingly lust. That charge he has
  finally dispelled. Henry VIII. was not the monster that Lingard painted.
  He beheaded two queens, but few will be found to assert to-day that
  either Anne Boleyn or Catherine Howard were innocent martyrs. People must
  agree to differ to the crack of doom as to the justice of Catherine's
  divorce. It is one of those questions which different men will continue
  to answer in different ways. But one thing is abundantly clear. If Henry
  was actuated merely by passion for Anne Boleyn, he would scarcely have
  waited for years before putting Queen Catherine away. Henry divorced Anne
  of Cleves, but Anne, who survived the dissolution of her marriage and
  remained in England for twenty years, made no complaint of her treatment,
  and she has had no champions either among Catholic or Protestant writers.
  Her divorce is only remembered as the occasion of the downfall of the
  greatest statesman of his age, Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex. But in his
  eagerness to proclaim the truth, Froude went on to defend a paradox. Once
  free from the charge of lust,&mdash;and compared with Francis of France
  or Charles V., Henry was a continent man&mdash;Henry became to Froude the
  ideal monarch.</p>

  <p>Some one has said that Henry VIII. was the greatest king that ever
  lived, because he always got his own way. If that be the test, then Henry
  was indeed "every inch a king." He broke with Rome; he deposed the Pope
  from his supremacy over England; he dissolved the monasteries; he sent
  the noblest and wisest in England to the scaffold; he reduced Wales to
  law and order and gave her a constitution; he married and unmarried as he
  liked; he disposed of the succession to the throne of England by his
  will; and his people never murmured. Only once, when the Pilgrimage of
  Grace broke out, was his throne in any danger, and that insurrection he
  easily suppressed. He made war with France; he invaded Scotland more than
  once, and every time with striking success. He played his vigorous part
  in European politics, and at his death he left his realm inviolate. It is
  an amazing record, which might well dazzle a writer of Froude's
  temperament and training. But there are dark shades in the picture, which
  Froude was content to make little of, if not to ignore. He is fond of
  contrasting Henry's way with conspirators with that of his <!-- Page
  xviii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
  daughter Elizabeth. He sneers at her "tenderness" towards high-born
  traitors, and never ceases to reproach her with her one act of repression
  after the Yorkshire rising. But he had not a word to say against the
  tyrannical murders of Henry VIII. Elizabeth truly boasted that she never
  punished opinion: Henry sent to the scaffold better men than himself for
  holding academical opinions contrary to his own. Cardinal Fisher may have
  been&mdash;after the publication of Chappuys's letters it is not possible to
  deny that he was&mdash;technically guilty of treason. But he was a saint
  and an old man past eighty, and "the earth on the edge of the grave was
  already crumbling under his feet." The king spared neither age nor worth
  nor innocence. He had been the familiar friend of More; he had walked
  through his gardens at Chelsea leaning on his arm; More had been his
  chancellor; he was still the greatest of his subjects; while frankly
  admitting that he differed in opinion from the king on the question of
  the royal supremacy, he promised that he would not try to influence
  others. Henry was inexorable. He not only condemned him to die a
  traitor's death,&mdash;he added a callous message, which still rouses the
  indignation of every generous soul, that he should "not use many words on
  the scaffold." Thomas Cromwell had served him as few ministers have
  served a king; to him was due&mdash;or, at least, he was the capable
  instrument of&mdash;the policy which has given distinction to Henry's
  reign; but he was delivered over to his enemies when the king's caprice
  had shifted to another quarter. Even Froude finds it difficult to excuse
  the execution of More and Cromwell. But, having once made up his mind to
  make a hero of Henry, he goes on with it bravely to the end. He hides
  nothing, he excuses nothing, he extenuates nothing. Neither the death of
  the aged Countess of Salisbury or of the gallant Earl of Surrey, nor the
  illegal imprisonment of the aged Norfolk, the hero of Flodden, shakes his
  faith in his hero-king. He even relates, with minute detail, how a few
  days before the king's death, four poor persons, one of whom was a
  tailor, were burnt at the stake for denying the Real Presence. But his
  final comment on it all was: "His personal faults were great, and he
  shared, besides them, in the errors of his age; but far deeper blemishes
  would be but scars upon the features of a sovereign who in trying times
  sustained nobly the honour of the English name, and carried the
  commonwealth securely through the hardest crisis in its history."</p>

<!-- Page xix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexix"></a>[xix]</span>

  <p>When a young man Froude had been elected Fellow of Exeter College,
  Oxford. This entailed his taking holy orders, though he does not seem to
  have regularly performed the duties of a clergyman. In 1849 he published
  his first book, <i>The Nemesis of Faith</i>, now happily forgotten. It
  raised an immediate commotion. It was denounced as heretical, and the
  senior tutor of Exeter burnt it during a lecture in the College Hall.
  Froude resigned his Fellowship, and his connection with the university
  was severed for thirty-three years. He was one of the first to take
  advantage of the alteration of the law which enabled a clergyman to
  resign his orders. In 1892 he went back to Oxford as Regius Professor of
  Modern History. "The temptation of going back to Oxford in a respectable
  way," he said, "was too much for me." He died on October 20, 1894, and on
  his tombstone he is simply described, by his own wish, as Professor of
  Modern History in the University of Oxford.</p>

<h1>HENRY VIII</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>SOCIAL CONDITION OF ENGLAND IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

  <p>In periods like the present, when knowledge is every day extending,
  and the habits and thoughts of mankind are perpetually changing under the
  influence of new discoveries, it is no easy matter to throw ourselves
  back into a time in which for centuries the European world grew upon a
  single type, in which the forms of the father's thoughts were the forms
  of the son's, and the late descendant was occupied in treading into paths
  the footprints of his distant ancestors. So absolutely has change become
  the law of our present condition, that it is identified with energy and
  moral health; to cease to change is to lose place in the great race; and
  to pass away from off the earth with the same convictions which we found
  when we entered it, is to have missed the best object for which we now
  seem to exist.</p>

  <p>It has been, however, with the race of men as it has been with the
  planet which they inhabit. As we look back over history, we see times of
  change and progress alternating with other times when life and thought
  have settled into permanent forms; when mankind, as if by common consent,
  have ceased to seek for increase of knowledge, and, contented with what
  they possess, have endeavoured to make use of it for purposes of moral
  cultivation. Such was the condition of the Greeks through many ages
  before the Persian war; such was that of the Romans till the world
  revenged itself upon its conquerors by the introduction among them of the
  habits of the conquered; and such again became the condition of Europe
  when the Northern nations grafted the religion and the laws of the
  Western empire on their own hardy natures, and shaped out that wonderful
  spiritual and political organisation which remained unshaken for a
  thousand years.</p>

  <p>The aspirant after sanctity in the fifteenth century of the <!-- Page
  2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span> Christian
  era found a model which he could imitate in detail in the saint of the
  fifth. The gentleman at the court of Edward IV. or Charles of Burgundy
  could imagine no nobler type of heroism than he found in the stories of
  King Arthur's knights. The forms of life had become more
  elaborate&mdash;the surface of it more polished&mdash;but the life itself
  remained essentially the same; it was the development of the same
  conception of human excellence; just as the last orders of Gothic
  architecture were the development of the first, from which the idea had
  worked its way till the force of it was exhausted.</p>

  <p>A condition of things differing alike both outwardly and inwardly from
  that into which a happier fortune has introduced ourselves, is
  necessarily obscure to us. In the alteration of our own character, we
  have lost the key which would interpret the characters of our fathers,
  and the great men even of our own English history before the Reformation
  seem to us almost like the fossil skeletons of another order of beings.
  Some broad conclusions as to what they were are at least possible to us,
  however; and we are able to determine, with tolerable certainty, the
  social condition of the people of this country, such as it was before the
  movements of the sixteenth century, and during the process of those
  movements.</p>

  <p>The extent of the population can only be rudely conjectured. A rough
  census was taken at the time of the Armada, when it was found to be
  something under five millions; but anterior to this I can find no
  authority on which I can rely with any sort of confidence. It is my
  impression, however, from a number of reasons&mdash;each in itself
  insignificant, but which taken together leave little doubt upon my
  mind&mdash;that it had attained that number by a growth so slow as to be
  scarcely perceptible, and had nearly approached to it many generations
  before. Simon Fish, in <i>The Supplication of Beggars</i>,<a
  name="NtA_1"></a><a href="#Nt_1"><sup>1</sup></a> says that the number of
  households in England in 1531 was 520,000. His calculation is of the most
  random kind; for he rates the number of parishes at 52,000, with ten
  households on an average in each parish. A mistake so preposterous
  respecting the number of parishes shows the great ignorance of educated
  men upon the subject. The ten households in each parish may, probably (in
  some parts of the country), have been a correct computation; but this
  tells us little with respect to the aggregate numbers, for the households
  were very large&mdash;the farmers, and the gentlemen also, usually having
  all the persons whom <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span> they employed residing under their own
  roof. Neither from this, therefore, nor from any other positive statement
  which I have seen, can I gather any conclusion that may be depended upon.
  But when we remember the exceeding slowness with which the population
  multiplied in a time in which we can accurately measure it&mdash;that is
  to say, from 1588 to the opening of the last century&mdash;under
  circumstances in every way more favourable to an increase, I think we may
  assume that the increase was not so great between 1500 and 1588, and
  that, previous to 1500, it did not more than keep pace with the waste
  from civil and foreign war. The causes, indeed, were wholly wanting which
  lead to a rapid growth of numbers. Numbers now increase with the increase
  of employment and with the facilities which are provided by the modern
  system of labour for the establishment of independent households. At
  present, any able-bodied unskilled labourer earns, as soon as he has
  arrived at man's estate, as large an amount of wages as he will earn at
  any subsequent time; and having no connection with his employer beyond
  the receiving the due amount of weekly money from him, and thinking
  himself as well able to marry as he is likely to be, he takes a wife, and
  is usually the father of a family before he is thirty. Before the
  Reformation, not only were early marriages determinately discouraged, but
  the opportunity for them did not exist. A labourer living in a cottage by
  himself was a rare exception to the rule; and the work of the field was
  performed generally, as it now is in the large farms in America and
  Australia, by servants who lived in the families of the squire or the
  farmer, and who, while in that position, commonly remained single, and
  married only when by prudence they had saved a sufficient sum to enable
  them to enter some other position.</p>

  <p>Checked by circumstances of this kind, population would necessarily
  remain almost stationary, and a tendency to an increase was not of itself
  regarded by the statesmen of the day as any matter for congratulation or
  as any evidence of national prosperity. Not an increase of population,
  which would facilitate production and beat down wages by competition, but
  the increase of the commonwealth, the sound and healthy maintenance of
  the population already existing, were the chief objects which the
  government proposed to itself; and although Henry VIII. carefully nursed
  his manufactures, there is sufficient proof in the grounds alleged for
  the measures to which he resorted, that there was little redundancy of
  occupation.</p>

<!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>

  <p>In a statute, for instance, for the encouragement of the linen
  manufactures, it is said<a name="NtA_2"></a><a
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that&mdash;"The King's Highness, calling to
  his most blessed remembrance the great number of idle people daily
  increasing throughout this his Realm, supposeth that one great cause
  thereof is by the continued bringing into the same the great number of
  wares and merchandise made, and brought out and from, the parts beyond
  the sea into this his Realm, ready wrought by manual occupation; amongst
  the which wares one kind of merchandise in great quantity, which is linen
  cloth of divers sorts made in divers countries beyond the sea, is daily
  conveyed into this Realm; which great quantity of linen cloth so brought
  is consumed and spent within the same; by reason whereof not only the
  said strange countries where the said linen cloth is made, by the policy
  and industry of making and vending the same are greatly enriched; and a
  marvellous great number of their people, men, women, and children, are
  set on work and occupation, and kept from idleness, to the great
  furtherance and advancement of their commonwealth; but also contrariwise
  the inhabitants and subjects of this Realm, for lack of like policy and
  industry, are compelled to buy all or most part of the linen cloth
  consumed in the same, amounting to inestimable sums of money. And also
  the people of this Realm, as well men as women, which should and might be
  set on work, by exercise of like policy and craft of spinning, weaving,
  and making of cloth, lies now in idleness and otiosity, to the high
  displeasure of Almighty God, great diminution of the King's people, and
  extreme ruin, decay, and impoverishment of this Realm. Therefore, for
  reformation of these things, the King's most Royal Majesty intending,
  like a most virtuous Prince, to provide remedy in the premises; nothing
  so much coveting as the increase of the Commonwealth of this his Realm,
  with also the virtuous exercise of his most loving subjects and people,
  and to avoid that most abominable sin of idleness out of the Realm, hath,
  by the advice and consent of his Lords and Commons in Parliament
  assembled, ordained and enacted that every person occupying land for
  tillage, shall for every sixty acres which he hath under the plough, sow
  one quarter of an acre in flax or hemp."</p>

  <p>This Act was designed immediately to keep the wives and children of
  the poor in work in their own houses;<a name="NtA_3"></a><a
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but it leaves <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> no doubt that
  manufactures in England had not of themselves that tendency to
  self-development which would encourage an enlarging population. The
  woollen manufactures similarly appear, from the many statutes upon them,
  to have been vigorous at a fixed level, but to have shown no tendency to
  rise beyond that level. With a fixed market and a fixed demand,
  production continued uniform.</p>

  <p>A few years subsequent, indeed, to the passing of the Act which I have
  quoted, a very curious complaint is entered in the statute book, from the
  surface of which we should gather, that so far from increasing,
  manufactures had alarmingly declined. The fact mentioned may bear another
  meaning, and a meaning far more favourable to the state of the country;
  although, if such a phenomenon were to occur at the present time, it
  could admit of but one interpretation. In the 18th and 19th of the 32nd
  of Henry VIII., all the important towns in England, from the Tweed to the
  Land's End, are stated, one by one, to have fallen into serious decay.
  Usually when we meet with language of this kind, we suppose it to mean
  nothing more than an awakening to the consciousness of evils which had
  long existed, and which had escaped notice only because no one was alive
  to them. In the present instance, however, the language was too strong
  and too detailed to allow of this explanation; and the great body of the
  English towns undoubtedly were declining in wealth and in the number of
  their inhabitants. "Divers and many beautiful houses of habitation,"
  these statutes say, "built in tyme past within their walls and liberties,
  now are fallen down and decayed, and at this day remain unre-edified, and
  do lie as desolate and vacant grounds, many of them nigh adjoining to the
  High-streets, replenished with much uncleanness and filth, with pits,
  sellers, and vaults lying open and uncovered, to the great perill and
  danger of the inhabitants and other the King's subjects passing by the
  same; and some houses be very weak and feeble, ready to fall down, and
  therefore dangerous to pass by, to the great decay and hinderance of the
  said boroughs and towns."<a name="NtA_4"></a><a
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

  <p>At present, the decay of a town implies the decay of the trade <!--
  Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> of the
  town; and the decay of all towns simultaneously would imply a general
  collapse of the trade of the whole country. Walled towns, however, before
  the Reformation, existed for other purposes than as the centre points of
  industry: they existed for the protection of property and life: and
  although it is not unlikely that the agitation of the Reformation itself
  did to some degree interrupt the occupation of the people, yet I believe
  that the true account of the phenomenon which then so much disturbed the
  parliament, is, that one of their purposes was no longer required; the
  towns flagged for a time because the country had become secure. The
  woollen manufacture in Worcestershire was spreading into the open
  country,<a name="NtA_5"></a><a href="#Nt_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and,
  doubtless, in other counties as well; and the "beautiful houses" which
  had fallen into decay, were those which, in the old times of insecurity,
  had been occupied by wealthy merchants and tradesmen, who were now
  enabled, by a strong and settled government, to dispense with the shelter
  of locked gates and fortified walls, and remove their residences to more
  convenient situations. It was, in fact, the first symptom of the
  impending social revolution. Two years before the passing of this Act,
  the magnificent Hengrave Hall, in Suffolk, had been completed by Sir
  Thomas Kitson, "mercer of London,"<a name="NtA_6"></a><a
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and Sir Thomas Kitson was but one of many
  of the rising merchants who were now able to root themselves on the land
  by the side of the Norman nobility, first to rival, and then slowly to
  displace them.</p>

  <p>This mighty change, however, was long in silent progress before it
  began to tell on the institutions of the country. When city burghers
  bought estates, the law insisted jealously on their accepting with them
  all the feudal obligations. Attempts to use the land as "a commodity"
  were, as we shall presently see, angrily repressed; while, again, in the
  majority of instances, such persons endeavoured, as they do at present,
  to cover the recent origin of their families by adopting the manners of
  the nobles, instead of transferring the habits of the towns to the parks
  and chases of the English counties. The old English organisation
  maintained its full activity; and the duties of property continued to be
  for another century more considered than its rights.</p>

  <p>Turning, then, to the tenure of land&mdash;for if we would understand
  the condition of the people, it is to this point that our first attention
  must be directed&mdash;we find that through the many <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> complicated varieties
  of it there was one broad principle which bore equally upon every class,
  that the land of England must provide for the defence of England. The
  feudal system, though practically modified, was still the organising
  principle of the nation, and the owner of land was bound to military
  service for his country whenever occasion required. Further, the land was
  to be so administered, that the accustomed number of families supported
  by it should not be diminished, and that the State should suffer no
  injury from the carelessness or selfishness of the owners.<a
  name="NtA_7"></a><a href="#Nt_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Land never was private
  property in that personal sense of property in which we speak of a thing
  as our own, with which we may do as we please; and in the administration
  of estates, as indeed in the administration of all property whatsoever,
  duty to the State was at all times supposed to override private interest
  or inclination. Even tradesmen, who took advantage of the fluctuations of
  the market, were rebuked by parliament for "their greedy and covetous
  minds," "as more regarding their own singular lucre and profit than the
  commonweal of the Realm;"<a name="NtA_8"></a><a
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>8</sup></a> and although in an altered world, neither
  industry nor enterprise will thrive except under the stimulus of
  self-interest, we may admire the confidence which in another age expected
  every man to prefer the advantage of the community to his own. All land
  was held upon a strictly military principle. It was the representative of
  authority, and the holder or the owner took rank in the army of the State
  according to the nature of his connection with it. It was first broadly
  divided among the great nobility holding immediately under the crown,
  who, above and beyond the ownership of their private estates, were the
  Lords of the Fee throughout their presidency, and possessed in right of
  it the services of knights and gentlemen who held their manors under
  them, and who followed their standard in war. Under the lords of manors,
  again, small freeholds and copyholds were held of various extent, often
  forty shilling and twenty shilling value, tenanted by peasant occupiers,
  who thus, on their own land, lived as free Englishmen, maintaining by
  their own free labour themselves and their families. There was thus a
  descending scale of owners, each of whom possessed his separate right,
  which the law guarded and none might violate; yet no one of whom, again,
  was independent of an authority higher than himself; and the entire body
  of the English free possessors of the soil was interpenetrated by a
  coherent organisation which <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> converted them into a perpetually
  subsisting army of soldiers. The extent of land which was held by the
  petty freeholders was very large, and the possession of it was jealously
  treasured; the private estates of the nobles and gentlemen were either
  cultivated by their own servants, or let out, as at present, to free
  tenants; or (in earlier times) were occupied by villains, a class who,
  without being bondmen, were expected to furnish further services than
  those of the field, services which were limited by the law, and
  recognised by an outward ceremony, a solemn oath and promise from the
  villain to his lord. Villanage, in the reign of Henry VIII., had
  practically ceased. The name of it last appears upon the statute book in
  the early years of the reign of Richard II., when the disputes between
  villains and their liege lords on their relative rights had furnished
  matter for cumbrous lawsuits, and by general consent the relation had
  merged of itself into a more liberal form. Thus serfdom had merged or was
  rapidly merging into free servitude; but it did not so merge that
  labouring men, if they pleased, were allowed to live in idleness. Every
  man was regimented somewhere; and although the peasantry, when at full
  age, were allowed, under restrictions, their own choice of masters, yet
  the restrictions both on masters and servants were so severe as to
  prevent either from taking advantage of the necessities of the other, or
  from terminating through caprice or levity, or for any insufficient
  reason, a connection presumed to be permanent.<a name="NtA_9"></a><a
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

  <p>Through all these arrangements a single aim is visible, that every man
  in England should have his definite place and definite duty assigned to
  him, and that no human being should be at liberty to lead at his own
  pleasure an unaccountable existence. The discipline of an army was
  transferred to the details of social life, and it issued in a chivalrous
  perception of the meaning of the word duty, and in the old characteristic
  spirit of English loyalty.</p>

  <p>From the regulations with respect to land, a coarser advantage was
  also derived, of a kind which at the present time will be effectively
  appreciated. It is a common matter of dispute whether landed estates
  should be large or small; whether it is better that the land should be
  divided among small proprietors, cultivating their own ground, or that it
  should follow its present tendency, and be shared by a limited and
  constantly diminishing number of wealthy landlords. The advocates for a
  peasant proprietary tell us truly, that a landed monopoly is dangerous;
  <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
  that the possession of a spot of ground, though it be but a few acres, is
  the best security for loyalty, giving the state a pledge for its owner,
  and creating in the body of the nation a free, vigorous, and manly
  spirit. The advocates for the large estates tell us, that the masses are
  too ill-educated to be trusted with independence; that without authority
  over them, these small proprietors become wasteful, careless,
  improvident; that the free spirit becomes a democratic and dangerous
  spirit; and finally, that the resources of the land cannot properly be
  brought out by men without capital to cultivate it. Either theory is
  plausible. The advocates of both can support their arguments with an
  appeal to experience; and the verdict of fact has not as yet been
  pronounced emphatically.</p>

  <p>The problem will be resolved in the future history of this country. It
  was also nobly and skilfully resolved in the past. The knights and nobles
  retained the authority and power which was attached to the lordships of
  the fees. They retained extensive estates in their own hands or in the
  occupation of their immediate tenants; but the large proportion of the
  lands was granted out by them to smaller owners, and the expenditure of
  their own incomes in the wages and maintenance of their vast retinues
  left but a small margin for indulgence in luxuries. The necessities of
  their position obliged them to regard their property rather as a revenue
  to be administered in trust, than as "a fortune" to be expended in
  indulgence. Before the Reformation, while the differences of social
  degree were enormous, the differences in habits of life were
  comparatively slight, and the practice of men in these things was
  curiously the reverse of our own. Dress, which now scarcely suffices to
  distinguish the master from his servant, was then the symbol of rank,
  prescribed by statute to the various orders of society as strictly as the
  regimental uniform to officers and privates; diet also was prescribed,
  and with equal strictness; but the diet of the nobleman was ordered down
  to a level which was then within the reach of the poorest labourer. In
  1336, the following law was enacted by the Parliament of Edward III.:<a
  name="NtA_10"></a><a href="#Nt_10"><sup>10</sup></a> "Whereas, heretofore
  through the excessive and over-many sorts of costly meats which the
  people of this Realm have used more than elsewhere, many mischiefs have
  happened to the people of this Realm&mdash;for the great men by these
  excesses have been sore grieved; and the lesser people, who only
  endeavour to imitate the great ones in such sort of meats, are much
  impoverished, <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> whereby they are not able to aid
  themselves, nor their liege lord, in time of need, as they ought; and
  many other evils have happened, as well to their souls as their
  bodies&mdash;our Lord the King, desiring the common profit as well of the
  great men as the common people of his Realm, and considering the evils,
  grievances, and mischiefs aforesaid, by the common assent of the
  prelates, earls, barons, and other nobles of his said Realm, and of the
  commons of the same Realm, hath ordained and established that no man, of
  what estate or condition soever he be, shall cause himself to be served,
  in his house or elsewhere, at dinner, meal, or supper, or at any other
  time, with more than two courses, and each mess of two sorts of victuals
  at the utmost, be it of flesh or fish, with the common sorts of pottage,
  without sauce or any other sorts of victuals. And if any man choose to
  have sauce for his mess, he may, provided it be not made at great cost;
  and if fish or flesh be to be mixed therein, it shall be of two sorts
  only at the utmost, either fish or flesh, and shall stand instead of a
  mess, except only on the principal feasts of the year, on which days
  every man may be served with three courses at the utmost, after the
  manner aforesaid."</p>

  <p>Sumptuary laws are among the exploded fallacies which we have
  outgrown, and we smile at the unwisdom which could expect to regulate
  private habits and manners by statute. Yet some statutes may be of moral
  authority when they cannot be actually enforced, and may have been
  regarded, even at the time at which they were issued, rather as an
  authoritative declaration of what wise and good men considered to be
  right, than as laws to which obedience could be compelled. This act, at
  any rate, witnesses to what was then thought to be right by "the great
  persons" of the English realm; and when great persons will submit
  themselves of their free will to regulations which restrict their private
  indulgence, they are in little danger of disloyalty from those whom
  fortune has placed below them.</p>

  <p>Such is one aspect of these old arrangements; it is unnecessary to say
  that with these, as with all other institutions created and worked by
  human beings, the picture admits of being reversed. When by the accident
  of birth men are placed in a position of authority, no care in their
  training will prevent it from falling often to singularly unfit persons.
  The command of a permanent military force was a temptation to ambition,
  to avarice, or hatred, to the indulgence of private piques and
  jealousies, to political discontent on private and personal grounds. A
  combination of three or four of the leading nobles <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> was sufficient, when
  an incapable prince sate on the throne, to effect a revolution; and the
  rival claims of the houses of York and Lancaster to the crown, took the
  form of a war unequalled in history for its fierce and determined
  malignancy, the whole nation tearing itself in pieces in a quarrel in
  which no principle was at stake, and no national object was to be gained.
  A more terrible misfortune never befel either this or any other country,
  and it was made possible only in virtue of that loyalty with which the
  people followed the standard, through good and evil, of their feudal
  superiors. It is still a question, however, whether the good or the evil
  of the system predominated; and the answer to such question is the more
  difficult because we have no criterion by which, in these matters,
  degrees of good and evil admit of being measured. Arising out of the
  character of the nation, it reflected this character in all its
  peculiarities; and there is something truly noble in the coherence of
  society upon principles of fidelity. Fidelity of man to man is among the
  rarest excellences of humanity, and we can tolerate large evils which
  arise out of such a cause. Under the feudal system men were held together
  by oaths, free acknowledgments, and reciprocal obligations, entered into
  by all ranks, high and low, binding servants to their masters, as well as
  nobles to their kings; and in the frequent forms of the language in which
  the oaths were sworn we cannot choose but see that we have lost something
  in exchanging these ties for the harsher connecting links of mutual
  self-interest.</p>

  <p>"When a freeman shall do fealty to his lord," the statute says, "he
  shall hold his right hand upon the book, and shall say thus:&mdash;Hear
  you, my lord, that I shall be to you both faithful and true, and shall
  owe my faith to you for the land that I hold, and lawfully shall do such
  customs and services as my duty is to you, at the times assigned, so help
  me God and all his saints."</p>

  <p>"The villain," also, "when he shall do fealty to his lord, shall hold
  his right hand over the book, and shall say:&mdash;Hear you, my lord,
  that I from this day forth unto you shall be true and faithful, and shall
  owe you fealty for the land which I hold of you in villanage; and that no
  evil or damage will I see concerning you, but I will defend and warn you
  to my power. So help me God and all his saints."<a name="NtA_11"></a><a
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

  <p>Again, in the distribution of the produce of land, men dealt fairly
  and justly with each other; and in the material condition of the bulk of
  the people there is a fair evidence that the system <!-- Page 12 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> worked efficiently
  and well. It worked well for the support of a sturdy high-hearted race,
  sound in body and fierce in spirit, and furnished with thews and sinews
  which, under the stimulus of those "great shins of beef,"<a
  name="NtA_12"></a><a href="#Nt_12"><sup>12</sup></a> their common diet,
  were the wonder of the age. "What comyn folke in all this world," says a
  state paper in 1515<a name="NtA_13"></a><a
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>13</sup></a> "may compare with the comyns of England
  in riches, freedom, liberty, welfare, and all prosperity? What comyn
  folke is so mighty, so strong in the felde, as the comyns of England?"
  The relative numbers of the French and English armies which fought at
  Cressy and Agincourt may have been exaggerated, but no allowance for
  exaggeration will effect the greatness of those exploits; and in stories
  of authentic actions under Henry VIII., where the accuracy of the account
  is undeniable, no disparity of force made Englishmen shrink from enemies
  wherever they could meet them. Again and again a few thousands of them
  carried dismay into the heart of France. Four hundred adventurers,
  vagabond apprentices, from London,<a name="NtA_14"></a><a
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>14</sup></a> who formed a volunteer corps in the
  Calais garrison, were for years the terror of Normandy. In the very
  frolic of conscious power they fought and plundered, without pay, without
  reward, except what they could win for themselves; and when they fell at
  last they fell only when surrounded by six times their number, and were
  cut to pieces in careless desperation. Invariably, by friend and enemy
  alike, the English are described as the fiercest people in all Europe
  (the English wild beasts, Benvenuto Cellini calls them); and this great
  physical power they owed to the profuse abundance in which they lived,
  and to the soldier's training in which every man of them was bred from
  childhood. The state of the working classes can, however, be more
  certainly determined by a comparison of their wages with the prices of
  food. Both were regulated, so far as regulation was <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> possible, by act of
  parliament, and we have therefore data of the clearest kind by which to
  judge. The majority of agricultural labourers lived, as I have said, in
  the houses of their employers; this, however, was not the case with all,
  and if we can satisfy ourselves as to the rate at which those among the
  poor were able to live who had cottages of their own, we may be assured
  that the rest did not live worse at their masters' tables.</p>

  <p>Wheat, the price of which necessarily varied, averaged in the middle
  of the fourteenth century tenpence the bushel;<a name="NtA_15"></a><a
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>15</sup></a> barley averaging at the same time three
  shillings the quarter. With wheat the fluctuation was excessive; a table
  of its possible variations describes it as ranging from eighteenpence the
  quarter to twenty shillings; the average, however, being six and
  eightpence.<a name="NtA_16"></a><a href="#Nt_16"><sup>16</sup></a> When
  the price was above this sum, the merchants might import to bring it
  down;<a name="NtA_17"></a><a href="#Nt_17"><sup>17</sup></a> when it was
  below this price the farmers were allowed to export to the foreign
  markets.<a name="NtA_18"></a><a href="#Nt_18"><sup>18</sup></a> The same
  scale, with a scarcely appreciable tendency to rise, continued to hold
  until the disturbance in the value of the currency. In the twelve years
  from 1551 to 1562, although once before harvest wheat rose to the
  extraordinary price of forty-five shillings a quarter, it fell
  immediately after to five shillings and four.<a name="NtA_19"></a><a
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>19</sup></a> Six and eightpence continued to be
  considered in parliament as the average; <a name="NtA_20"></a><a
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>20</sup></a> and on the whole it seems to have been
  maintained for that time with little variation.<a name="NtA_21"></a><a
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

  <p>Beef and pork were a halfpenny a pound&mdash;mutton was three
  farthings. They were fixed at these prices by the 3rd of the 24th of Hen.
  VIII. But the act was unpopular both with buyers and with sellers. The
  old practice had been to sell in the gross, and under that arrangement
  the rates had been generally <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> lower. Stow says,<a name="NtA_22"></a><a
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>22</sup></a> "It was this year enacted that butchers
  should sell their beef and mutton by weight&mdash;beef for a halfpenny
  the pound, and mutton for three farthings; which being devised for the
  great commodity of the realm (as it was thought), hath proved far
  otherwise: for at that time fat oxen were sold for six and twenty
  shillings and eightpence the piece; fat wethers for three shillings and
  fourpence the piece; fat calves at a like price; and fat lambs for
  twelvepence. The butchers of London sold penny pieces of beef for the
  relief of the poor&mdash;every piece two pound and a half, sometimes
  three pound for a penny; and thirteen and sometimes fourteen of these
  pieces for twelvepence; mutton eightpence the quarter, and an hundred
  weight of beef for four shillings and eightpence." The act was repealed
  in consequence of the complaints against it,<a name="NtA_23"></a><a
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>23</sup></a> but the prices never fell again to what
  they had been, although beef sold in the gross could still be had for a
  halfpenny a pound in 1570.<a name="NtA_24"></a><a
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>24</sup></a> Other articles of food were in the same
  proportion. The best pig or goose in a country market could be bought for
  fourpence; a good capon for threepence or fourpence; a chicken for a
  penny; a hen for twopence.<a name="NtA_25"></a><a
  href="#Nt_25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>

  <p>Strong beer, such as we now buy for eighteenpence a gallon, was then a
  penny a gallon;<a name="NtA_26"></a><a href="#Nt_26"><sup>26</sup></a>
  and table-beer less than a halfpenny. French and German wines were
  eightpence the gallon. Spanish and Portuguese wines a shilling. This was
  the highest price at which the best wines might be sold; and if there was
  any fault in quality or quantity, the dealers forfeited four times the
  amount.<a name="NtA_27"></a><a href="#Nt_27"><sup>27</sup></a> Rent,
  another important consideration, cannot be <!-- Page 16 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> fixed so accurately,
  for parliament did not interfere with it. Here, however, we are not
  without very tolerable information. "My father," says Latimer,<a
  name="NtA_28"></a><a href="#Nt_28"><sup>28</sup></a> "was a yeoman, and
  had no lands of his own; only he had a <i>farm of three or four pounds by
  the year</i> at the uttermost, and hereupon he tilled so much as kept
  half-a-dozen men. He had walk for a hundred sheep, and my mother milked
  thirty kine. He was able, and did find the king a harness with himself
  and his horse. I remember that I buckled on his harness when he went to
  Blackheath field. He kept me to school, or else I had not been able to
  have preached before the King's Majesty now. He married my sisters with
  five pounds, or twenty nobles, each, having brought them up in godliness
  and fear of God. He kept hospitality for his poor neighbours, and some
  alms he gave to the poor; and all this he did of the said farm." If
  "three or four pounds at the uttermost" was the rent of a farm yielding
  such results, the rent of labourers' cottages is not likely to have been
  considerable.<a name="NtA_29"></a><a href="#Nt_29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some uncertainty is unavoidable in all calculations of the present
  nature; yet, after making the utmost allowances for errors, we may
  conclude from such a table of prices that a penny, in terms of the
  labourer's necessities, must have been nearly equal in the reign of Henry
  VIII. to the present shilling. For a penny, at the time of which I write,
  the labourer could buy as much bread, beef, beer, and wine&mdash;he could
  do as much towards finding lodging for himself and his family&mdash;as
  the labourer of the nineteenth century can for a shilling. I do not see
  that this admits of question. Turning, then, to the table of wages, it
  will be easy to ascertain his position. By the 3rd of the 6th of Henry
  VIII. it was enacted that master carpenters, masons, bricklayers, tylers,
  plumbers, glaziers, joiners, and other employers of such skilled workmen,
  should give to each of their journeymen, if no meat or drink was allowed,
  sixpence a day <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> for the half year, fivepence a day for
  the other half; or fivepence-halfpenny for the yearly average. The common
  labourers were to receive fourpence a day for half the year, for the
  remaining half, threepence.<a name="NtA_30"></a><a
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>30</sup></a> In the harvest months they were allowed
  to work by the piece, and might earn considerably more;<a
  name="NtA_31"></a><a href="#Nt_31"><sup>31</sup></a> so that, in fact
  (and this was the rate at which their wages were usually estimated), the
  day labourer, if in full employment, received on an average fourpence a
  day for the whole year. Allowing a deduction of one day in a fortnight
  for a saint's day or a holiday, he received, therefore, steadily and
  regularly, if well conducted, an equivalent of something near to twenty
  shillings a week, the wages at present paid in English colonies: and this
  is far from being a full account of his advantages. Except in rare
  instances, the agricultural labourer held land in connection with his
  house, while in most parishes, if not in all, there were large ranges of
  common and unenclosed forest land, which furnished his fuel to him
  gratis, where pigs might range, and ducks and geese; where, if he could
  afford a cow, he was in no danger of being unable to feed it; and so
  important was this privilege considered, that when the commons began to
  be largely enclosed, parliament insisted that the working man should not
  be without <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[pg
  18]</span> some piece of ground on which he could employ his own and his
  family's industry.<a name="NtA_32"></a><a href="#Nt_32"><sup>32</sup></a>
  By the 7th of the 31st of Elizabeth, it was ordered that no cottage
  should be built for residence without four acres of land at lowest being
  attached to it for the sole use of the occupants of such cottage.</p>

  <p>It will, perhaps, be supposed that such comparative prosperity of
  labour was the result of the condition of the market in which it was
  sold, that the demand for labour was large and the supply limited, and
  that the state of England in the sixteenth century was analogous to that
  of Australia or Canada at the present time. And so long as we confine our
  view to the question of wages alone, it is undoubted that legislation was
  in favour of the employer. The Wages Act of Henry VIII. was unpopular
  with the labourers, and was held to deprive them of an opportunity of
  making better terms for themselves.<a name="NtA_33"></a><a
  href="#Nt_33"><sup>33</sup></a> But we shall fall into extreme error if
  we translate into the language of modern political economy the social
  features of a state of things <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> which in no way correspond to our own.
  There was this essential difference, that labour was not looked upon as a
  market commodity; the government (whether wisely or not, I do not presume
  to determine) attempting to portion out the rights of the various classes
  of society by the rule, not of economy, but of equity. Statesmen did not
  care for the accumulation of capital; they desired to see the physical
  well-being of all classes of the commonwealth maintained at the highest
  degree which the producing power of the country admitted; and population
  and production remaining stationary, they were able to do it. This was
  their object, and they were supported in it by a powerful and efficient
  majority of the nation. On the one side parliament interfered to protect
  employers against their labourers; but it was equally determined that
  employers should not be allowed to abuse their opportunities; and this
  directly appears from the 4th of the 5th of Elizabeth, by which, on the
  most trifling appearance of a depreciation in the currency, it was
  declared that the labouring man could no longer live on the wages
  assigned to him by the act of Henry; and a sliding scale was instituted
  by which, for the future, wages should be adjusted to the price of
  food.<a name="NtA_34"></a><a href="#Nt_34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

  <p>The same conclusion may be gathered also, indirectly, from other acts,
  interfering imperiously with the rights of property where a disposition
  showed itself to exercise them selfishly. The city merchants, as I have
  said, were becoming landowners; and some of them attempted to apply the
  rules of trade to the management of landed estates. While wages were
  ruled so high, it answered better as a speculation to convert arable land
  into pasture; but the law immediately stepped in to prevent a proceeding
  which it regarded as petty treason to the commonwealth. Self-protection
  is the first law of life; and the country relying for its defence on an
  able-bodied population, evenly distributed, ready at any moment to be
  called into action, either against foreign invasion or civil disturbance,
  it could not permit the owners of land to pursue for their own benefit a
  course of action which threatened to weaken its garrisons. It is not
  often that we are able to test the wisdom of legislation by specific
  results so clearly as in the present instance. The first attempts of the
  kind which I have described were made in the Isle of Wight, early in the
  reign of Henry VII. Lying so <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> directly exposed to attacks from France,
  the Isle of Wight was a place which it was peculiarly important to keep
  in a state of defence, and the following act was therefore the
  consequence:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Forasmuch as it is to the surety of the Realm of England that the
  Isle of Wight, in the county of Southampton, be well inhabited with
  English people, for the defence as well of our antient enemies of the
  Realm of France as of other parties; the which Isle is late decayed of
  people by reason that many towns and villages have been let down, and the
  fields dyked and made pasture for beasts and cattle, and also many
  dwelling-places, farms, and farmholds have of late time been used to be
  taken into one man's hold and hands, that of old time were wont to be in
  many several persons' holds and hands, and many several households kept
  in them; and thereby much people multiplied, and the same Isle thereby
  well inhabited, which now, by the occasion aforesaid, is desolate and not
  inhabited, but occupied with beasts and cattle, so that if hasty remedy
  be not provided, that Isle cannot long be kept and defended, but open and
  ready to the hands of the king's enemies, which God forbid. For remedy
  hereof, it is ordained and enacted that no manner of person, of what
  estate, degree, or condition soever, shall take any several farms more
  than one, whereof the yearly value shall not exceed the sum of ten marks;
  and if any several leases afore this time have been made to any person or
  persons of divers and sundry farmholds, whereof the yearly value shall
  exceed that sum, then the said person or persons shall choose one
  farmhold at his pleasure, and the remnant of his leases shall be utterly
  void."<a name="NtA_35"></a><a href="#Nt_35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

  <p>An act, tyrannical in form, was singularly justified by its
  consequences. The farms were rebuilt, the lands reploughed, the island
  repeopled; and in 1546, when a French army of sixty thousand men
  attempted to effect a landing at St. Helen's, they were defeated and
  driven off by the militia of the island and a few levies transported from
  Hampshire and the adjoining counties.<a name="NtA_36"></a><a
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>36</sup></a> The money-making spirit, however, lay too
  deep to be checked so readily. The trading classes were growing rich
  under the strong rule of the Tudors. Increasing numbers of them were
  buying or renting land; and the symptoms complained of broke out in the
  following reign in many parts of <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> England. They could not choose but break
  out indeed; for they were the outward marks of a vital change, which was
  undermining the feudal constitution, and would by and bye revolutionise
  and destroy it. Such symptoms it was impossible to extinguish; but the
  government wrestled long and powerfully to hold down the new spirit; and
  they fought against it successfully, till the old order of things had
  finished its work, and the time was come for it to depart. By the 1st of
  the 7th of Henry VIII., the laws of feudal tenure were put in force
  against the landed traders. Wherever lands were converted from tillage to
  pasture, the lords of the fee had authority to seize half of all profits
  until the farm-buildings were reconstructed. If the immediate lord did
  not do his duty, the lord next above him was to do it; and the evil still
  increasing, the act, twenty years later, was extended further, and the
  king had power to seize.<a name="NtA_37"></a><a
  href="#Nt_37"><sup>37</sup></a> Nor was this all. Sheep-farming had
  become an integral branch of business; and falling into the hands of men
  who understood each other, it had been made a monopoly, affecting
  seriously the prices of wool and mutton.<a name="NtA_38"></a><a
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>38</sup></a> Stronger measures were therefore now
  taken, and the class to which the offenders belonged was especially
  pointed out by parliament.</p>

  <p>"Whereas," says the 13th of the 25th of Henry VIII., "divers and
  sundry persons of the king's subjects of this Realm, to whom God of his
  goodness hath disposed great plenty and abundance of moveable substance,
  now of late, within few years, have daily studied, practised, and
  invented ways and means how they might accumulate and gather together
  into few hands, as well great multitude of farms as great plenty of
  cattle, and in especial, sheep, putting such lands as they can get to
  pasture and not to tillage; whereby they have not only pulled <!-- Page
  22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> down
  churches and towns and enhanced the old rates of the rents of the
  possessions of this Realm, or else brought it to such excessive fines
  that no poor man is able to meddle with it, but also have raised and
  enhanced the prices of all manner of corn, cattle, wool, pigs, geese,
  hens, chickens, eggs, and such other commodities, almost double above the
  prices which hath been accustomed, by reason whereof a marvellous
  multitude of the poor people of this realm be not able to provide meat,
  drink, and clothes necessary for themselves, their wives, and children,
  but be so discouraged with misery and poverty, that they fall daily to
  theft, robbery, and other inconveniences, or pitifully die for hunger and
  cold; and it is thought by the king's humble and loving subjects, that
  one of the greatest occasions that moveth those greedy and covetous
  people so to accumulate and keep in their hands such great portions and
  parts of the lands of this Realm from the occupying of the poor
  husbandmen, and so to use it in pasture and not in tillage, is the great
  profit that cometh of sheep which be now come into a few persons' hands,
  in respect of the whole number of the king's subjects; it is hereby
  enacted, that no person shall have or keep on lands not their own
  inheritance more than 2000 sheep; that no person shall occupy more than
  two farms; and that the 19th of the 4th of Henry VII., and those other
  acts obliging the lords of the fees to do their duty, shall be re-enacted
  and enforced." <a name="NtA_39"></a><a
  href="#Nt_39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

  <p>By these measures the money-making spirit was for a time driven back,
  and the country resumed its natural course. I am not concerned to defend
  the economic wisdom of such proceedings; but they prove, I think,
  conclusively, that the labouring classes owed their advantages not to the
  condition of the labour market, but to the care of the state; and that
  when the state relaxed its supervision, or failed to enforce its
  regulations, the labourers being left to the market chances, sank
  instantly in the unequal struggle with capital.</p>

  <p>The government, however, remained strong enough to hold its ground
  (except during the discreditable interlude of the <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> reign of Edward VI.)
  for the first three quarters of the century; and until that time the
  working classes of this country remained in a condition more than
  prosperous. They enjoyed an abundance far beyond what in general falls to
  the lot of that order in long-settled countries; incomparably beyond what
  the same class were enjoying at that very time in Germany or France. The
  laws secured them; and that the laws were put in force we have the direct
  evidence of successive acts of the legislature justifying the general
  policy by its success: and we have also the indirect evidence of the
  contented loyalty of the great body of the people at a time when, if they
  had been discontented, they held in their own hands the means of
  asserting what the law acknowledged to be their right. The government had
  no power to compel submission to injustice, as was proved by the fate of
  an attempt to levy a "benevolence" by force, in 1525. The people resisted
  with a determination against which the crown commissioners were unable to
  contend, and the scheme ended with an acknowledgment of fault by Henry,
  who retired with a good grace from an impossible position. If the
  peasantry had been suffering under any real grievances we should not have
  failed to have heard of them when the religious rebellions furnished so
  fair an opportunity to press those grievances forward. Complaint was loud
  enough when complaint was just, under the Somerset protectorate. <a
  name="NtA_40"></a><a href="#Nt_40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

  <p>The incomes of the great nobles cannot be determined, for they varied
  probably as much as they vary now. Under Henry IV. the average income of
  an earl was estimated at £2000 a year.<a name="NtA_41"></a><a
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>41</sup></a> Under Henry VIII. the great Duke of
  Buckingham, the wealthiest English peer, had £6000.<a
  name="NtA_42"></a><a href="#Nt_42"><sup>42</sup></a> And the income of
  the <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[pg
  24]</span> Archbishop of Canterbury was rated at the same amount.<a
  name="NtA_43"></a><a href="#Nt_43"><sup>43</sup></a> But the
  establishments of such men were enormous; their ordinary retinues in time
  of peace consisting of many hundred persons; and in war, when the duties
  of a nobleman called him to the field, although in theory his followers
  were paid by the crown, yet the grants of parliament were on so small a
  scale that the theory was seldom converted into fact, and a large share
  of the expenses was paid often out of private purses. The Duke of
  Norfolk, in the Scotch war of 1523, declared (not complaining of it, but
  merely as a reason why he should receive support) that he had spent all
  his private means upon the army; and in the sequel of this history we
  shall find repeated instances of knights and gentlemen voluntarily
  ruining themselves in the service of their country. The people, not
  universally, but generally, were animated by a true spirit of sacrifice;
  by a true conviction that they were bound to think first of England, and
  only next of themselves; and unless we can bring ourselves to understand
  this, we shall never understand what England was under the reigns of the
  Plantagenets and Tudors. The expenses of the court under Henry VII. were
  a little over £14,000 a year, out of which were defrayed the whole cost
  of the king's establishment, the expenses of entertaining foreign
  ambassadors, the wages and maintenance of the yeomen of the guard, the
  retinues of servants, and all necessary outlay not incurred for public
  business. Under Henry VIII., of whose extravagance we have heard so much,
  and whose court was the most magnificent in the world, these expenses
  were £19,894 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,<a name="NtA_44"></a><a
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>44</sup></a> a small sum when compared with the
  present cost of the royal establishment, even if we adopt the relative
  estimate of twelve to one, and suppose it equal to £240,000 a year of our
  money. But indeed it was not equal to £240,000; for, although the
  proportion held in articles of common consumption, articles of luxury
  were very dear indeed.<a name="NtA_45"></a><a
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>

  <p>Passing down from the king and his nobles, to the body of the people,
  we find that the income qualifying a country gentleman to be justice of
  the peace was £20 a year, <a name="NtA_46"></a><a
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>46</sup></a> and if he did his duty, his office was no
  sinecure. We remember Justice Shallow and his clerk Davy, with his novel
  theory of magisterial law; and Shallow's broad features have so English a
  cast about them, that we may believe there were many such, and that the
  duty was not always very excellently done. But the Justice Shallows were
  not allowed to repose upon their dignity. The justice of the peace was
  required not only to take cognisance of open offences, but to keep
  surveillance over all persons within his district, and over himself in
  his own turn there was a surveillance no less sharp, and penalties for
  neglect prompt and peremptory.<a name="NtA_47"></a><a
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>47</sup></a> Four times a year he was to make
  proclamation of his duty, and exhort all persons to complain against him
  who had occasion.</p>

  <p>Twenty pounds a year, and heavy duties to do for it, represented the
  condition of the squire of the parish.<a name="NtA_48"></a><a
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>48</sup></a> By the 2nd of the 2nd of Henry V., "the
  wages" of a parish priest were limited to £5 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
  except in cases where there was special licence from the bishop, when
  they might be raised as high as £6. Priests were probably something
  better off under Henry VIII., but the statute remained in force, and
  marks an approach at least to their ordinary salary.<a
  name="NtA_49"></a><a href="#Nt_49"><sup>49</sup></a> The priest had
  enough, being <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> unmarried, to supply him in comfort with
  the necessaries of life. The squire had enough to provide moderate
  abundance for himself and his family. Neither priest nor squire was able
  to establish any steep difference in outward advantages between himself
  and the commons among whom he lived.</p>

<!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>

  <p>The habits of all classes were open, free, and liberal. There are two
  expressions corresponding one to the other, which we frequently meet with
  in old writings, and which are used as a kind of index, marking whether
  the condition of things was or <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span> was not what it ought to be. We read of
  "merry England;"&mdash;when England was not merry, things were not going
  well with it. We hear of "the glory of hospitality," England's
  pre-eminent <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> boast,-by the rules of which all tables,
  from the table of the twenty-shilling freeholder to the table in the
  baron's hall and abbey refectory, were open at the dinner hour to all
  comers, without stint or reserve, or question asked:<a
  name="NtA_50"></a><a href="#Nt_50"><sup>50</sup></a> to every man,
  according to his degree, who chose to ask for it there was free fee and
  free lodging; bread, beef, and beer for his dinner; for his lodging,
  perhaps, only a mat of rushes in a spare corner of the hall, with a
  billet of wood for a pillow,<a name="NtA_51"></a><a
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>51</sup></a> but freely offered and freely taken, the
  guest probably faring much as his host fared, neither worse nor better.
  There was little fear of an abuse of such licence, for suspicious
  characters had no leave to wander at pleasure; and for any man found at
  large and unable to give a sufficient account of himself, there were the
  ever-ready parish stocks or town gaol. The "glory of hospitality" lasted
  far down into Elizabeth's time; and then, as Camden says, "came in great
  bravery of building, to the marvellous beautifying of the realm, but to
  the decay" of what he valued more.</p>

  <p>In such frank style the people lived, hating three things with all
  their hearts: idleness, want, and cowardice; and for the rest carrying
  their hearts high, and having their hands full. The<a
  name="NtA_52"></a><a href="#Nt_52"><sup>52</sup></a> hour of rising,
  winter and summer, was four o'clock, with breakfast at five, after which
  the labourers went to work and the gentlemen to business, of which they
  had no little. In the country every unknown face was challenged and
  examined&mdash;if the account given was insufficient, he was brought
  before the justice; if the village shopkeeper sold bad wares, if the
  village cobbler made "unhonest" shoes, if servants and masters
  quarrelled, all was to be looked to by the justice; there was no fear
  lest time should hang heavy with him. At twelve he dined; after dinner he
  went hunting, or to his farm or to what he pleased.<a
  name="NtA_53"></a><a href="#Nt_53"><sup>53</sup></a> It was a life
  unrefined, perhaps, but coloured with a broad, rosy, English health.</p>

<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>

  <p>Of the education of noblemen and gentlemen we have contradictory
  accounts, as might be expected. The universities were well filled, by the
  sons of yeomen chiefly. The cost of supporting them at the colleges was
  little, and wealthy men took a pride in helping forward any boys of
  promise.<a name="NtA_54"></a><a href="#Nt_54"><sup>54</sup></a> It seems
  clear also, as the Reformation drew nearer, while the clergy were sinking
  lower and lower, a marked change for the better became perceptible in a
  portion at least of the laity. The more old-fashioned of the higher ranks
  were slow in moving; for as late as the reign of Edward VI.<a
  name="NtA_55"></a><a href="#Nt_55"><sup>55</sup></a> there were peers of
  parliament unable to read; but on the whole, the invention of printing,
  and the general ferment which was commencing all over the world, had
  produced marked effects in all classes. Henry VIII. himself spoke four
  languages, and was well read in theology and history; and the high
  accomplishments of More and Sir T. Elliott, of Wyatt and Cromwell, were
  but the extreme expression of a temper which was rapidly spreading, and
  which gave occasion, among other things to the following reflection in
  Erasmus. "Oh, strange vicissitudes of human things," exclaims he.
  "Heretofore the heart of learning was among such as professed religion.
  Now, while they for the most part give themselves up, <!-- Page 31
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> <i>ventri
  luxui pecuniæque</i>, the love of learning is gone from them to secular
  princes, the court and the nobility. May we not justly be ashamed of
  ourselves? The feasts of priests and divines are drowned in wine, are
  filled with scurrilous jests, sound with intemperate noise and tumult,
  flow with spiteful slanders and defamation of others; while at princes'
  tables modest disputations are held concerning things which make for
  learning and piety."</p>

  <p>A letter to Thomas Cromwell from his son's tutor will not be without
  interest on this subject; Cromwell was likely to have been unusually
  careful in his children's training, and we need not suppose that all boys
  were brought up as prudently. Sir Peter Carew, for instance, being a boy
  at about the same time, and giving trouble at the High School at Exeter,
  was led home to his father's house at Ottery, coupled between two
  foxhounds.<a name="NtA_56"></a><a href="#Nt_56"><sup>56</sup></a> Yet the
  education of Gregory Cromwell is probably not far above what many young
  men of the middle and higher ranks were beginning to receive. Henry Dowes
  was the tutor's name, beyond which fact I know nothing of him. His letter
  is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"After that it pleased your mastership to give me in charge, not only
  to give diligent attendance upon Master Gregory, but also to instruct him
  with good letters, honest manners, pastyme of instruments, and such other
  qualities as should be for him meet and convenient, pleaseth it you to
  understand that for the accomplishment thereof I have endeavoured myself
  by all ways possible to excogitate how I might most profit him. In which
  behalf, through his diligence, the success is such as I trust shall be to
  your good contentation and pleasure, and to his no small profit. But for
  cause the summer was spent in the service of the wild gods, [and] it is
  so much to be regarded after what fashion youth is brought up, in which
  time that that is learned for the most part will not be wholly forgotten
  in the older years, I think it my duty to acertain your mastership how he
  spendeth his time. And first after he hath heard mass he taketh a lecture
  of a dialogue of Erasmus' <i>Colloquies</i>, called <i>Pietas
  Puerilis</i>, wherein is described a very picture of one that should be
  virtuously brought up; and for cause it is so necessary for him, I do not
  only cause him to read it over, but also to practise the precepts of the
  same. After this he exerciseth his hand in writing one or two hours, and
  readeth upon Fabyan's <i>Chronicle</i> as long. The residue of the day he
  doth spend upon the lute <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> and virginals. When he rideth, as he
  doth very oft, I tell him by the way some history of the Romans or the
  Greeks, which I cause him to rehearse again in a tale. For his recreation
  he useth to hawk and hunt and shoot in his long bow, which frameth and
  succeedeth so well with him that he seemeth to be thereunto given by
  nature."<a name="NtA_57"></a><a href="#Nt_57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

  <p>I have spoken of the organisation of the country population, I have
  now to speak of that of the towns, of the trading classes and
  manufacturing classes, the regulations respecting which are no less
  remarkable and no less illustrative of the national character. If the
  tendency of trade to assume at last a form of mere self-interest be
  irresistible, if political economy represent the laws to which in the end
  it is forced to submit itself, the nation spared no efforts, either of
  art or policy, to defer to the last moment the unwelcome conclusion.</p>

  <p>The names and shadows linger about London of certain ancient
  societies, the members of which may still occasionally be seen in quaint
  gilt barges pursuing their own difficult way among the swarming steamers;
  when on certain days, the traditions concerning which are fast dying out
  of memory, the Fishmongers' Company, the Goldsmiths' Company, the
  Mercers' Company, make procession down the river for civic feastings at
  Greenwich or Blackwall. The stately tokens of ancient honour still belong
  to them, and the remnants of ancient wealth and patronage and power.
  Their charters may be read by curious antiquaries, and the bills of fare
  of their ancient entertainments. But for what purpose they were called
  into being, what there was in these associations of common trades to
  surround with gilded insignia, and how they came to be possessed of broad
  lands and church preferments, few people now care to think or to inquire.
  Trade and traders have no dignity any more in the eyes of any one, except
  what money lends to them; and these outward symbols scarcely rouse even a
  passing feeling of curiosity. And yet these companies were once something
  more than names. They are all which now remain of a vast organisation
  which once penetrated the entire trading life of England&mdash;an
  organisation set on foot to realise that most necessary, if most
  difficult, condition of commercial excellence under which man should deal
  faithfully with his brother, and all wares offered for sale, of whatever
  kind, should honestly be what they <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> pretend to be.<a
  name="NtA_58"></a><a href="#Nt_58"><sup>58</sup></a> I spoke of the
  military principle which directed the distribution and the arrangements
  of land. The analogy will best explain a state of things in which every
  occupation was treated as the division of an army; regiments being
  quartered in every town, each with its own self-elected officers, whose
  duty was to exercise authority over all persons professing the business
  to which they belonged; who were to see that no person undertook to
  supply articles which he had not been educated to manufacture; who were
  to determine the prices at which such articles ought justly to be sold;
  above all, who were to take care that the common people really bought at
  shops and stalls what they supposed themselves to be buying; that cloth
  put up for sale was true cloth, of true texture and full weight: that
  leather was sound and well tanned; wine pure, measures honest; flour
  unmixed with devil's dust;&mdash;who were generally to look to it that in
  all contracts between man and man for the supply of man's necessities,
  what we call honesty of dealing should be truly and faithfully
  observed.<a name="NtA_59"></a><a href="#Nt_59"><sup>59</sup></a> An
  organisation for this purpose did once really exist in England,<a
  name="NtA_60"></a><a href="#Nt_60"><sup>60</sup></a> really trying to do
  the work which it was intended to do, as half the pages of our early
  statutes witness. <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> In London, as the metropolis, a central
  council sate for every branch of trade, and this council was in
  communication with the Chancellor and the Crown. It was composed of the
  highest and most respectable members of the profession, and its office
  was to determine prices, fix wages, arrange the rules of apprenticeship,
  and discuss all details connected with the business on which legislation
  might be required. Further, this council received the reports of the
  searchers&mdash;high officers taken from their own body, whose business
  was to inspect, in company with the lord mayor or some other city
  dignitary, the shops of the respective traders; to receive complaints,
  and to examine into them. In each provincial town local councils sate in
  connection with the municipal authorities, who fulfilled in these places
  the same duties; and their reports being forwarded to the central body,
  and considered by them, representations on all necessary matters were
  then made to the privy council; and by the privy council, if requisite,
  were submitted to parliament. If these representations were judged to
  require legislative interference, the statutes which were passed in
  consequence were returned through the Chancellor to the mayors of the
  various towns and cities, by whom they were proclaimed as law. No person
  was allowed to open a trade or to commence a manufacture, either in
  London or the provinces, unless he had first served his apprenticeship;
  unless he could prove to the satisfaction of the authorities that he was
  competent in his craft; and unless he submitted as a matter of course to
  their supervision. The legislature had undertaken not to let that
  indispensable task go wholly unattempted, of distributing the various
  functions of society by the rule of capacity; of compelling every man to
  do his duty in an honest following of his proper calling, securing to him
  that he in his turn should not be injured by his neighbour's
  misdoings.</p>

  <p>The state further promising for itself that all able-bodied men should
  be found in work,<a name="NtA_61"></a><a href="#Nt_61"><sup>61</sup></a>
  and not allowing any man to work at a business for which he was unfit,
  insisted as its natural right that children should not be allowed to grow
  up in idleness, to be returned at mature age upon its hands. Every child,
  so far as possible, was to be trained up in some business or calling,<a
  name="NtA_62"></a><a href="#Nt_62"><sup>62</sup></a> idleness "being the
  mother of all sin," and the essential duty of every man being to provide
  honestly for himself and his family. The educative theory, for such it
  was, was simple but effective: it was based on the single principle that,
  next to the knowledge of a man's duty to God, and as a means towards <!--
  Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>
  doing that duty, the first condition of a worthy life was the ability to
  maintain it in independence. Varieties of inapplicable knowledge might be
  good, but they were not essential; such knowledge might be left to the
  leisure of after years, or it might be dispensed with without vital
  injury. Ability to labour could not be dispensed with, and this,
  therefore, the state felt it to be its own duty to see provided; so
  reaching, I cannot but think, the heart of the whole matter. The children
  of those who could afford the small entrance fees were apprenticed to
  trades, the rest were apprenticed to agriculture; and if children were
  found growing up idle, and their fathers or their friends failed to prove
  that they were able to secure them an ultimate maintenance, the mayors in
  towns and the magistrates in the country had authority to take possession
  of such children, and apprentice them as they saw fit, that when they
  grew up "they might not be driven" by want or incapacity "to dishonest
  courses."<a name="NtA_63"></a><a href="#Nt_63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

  <p>Such is an outline of the organisation of English society under the
  Plantagenets and Tudors. A detail of the working of the trade laws would
  be beyond my present purpose. It is obvious that such laws could be
  enforced only under circumstances when production and population remained
  (as I said before) nearly stationary; and it would be madness to attempt
  to apply them to the changed condition of the present. It would be well
  if some competent person would make these laws the subject of a special
  treatise. I will run the risk, however, of wearying the reader with two
  or three illustrative statutes, which I have chosen, not as being more
  significant than many others, but as specimens merely of the discipline
  under which, for centuries, the trade and manufactures of England
  contrived to move; showing on one side the good which the system
  effected, on the other the inevitable evils under which it finally
  sank.</p>

  <p>The first which I shall quote concerns simply the sale of specific
  goods and the means by which tradesmen were prevented from enhancing
  prices. The Act is the 6th of the 24th of Henry VIII., and concerns the
  sale of wines, the statute prices of which I have already mentioned.</p>

  <p>"Because," says this Act, "that divers merchants inhabiting within the
  city of London have of late not only presumed to bargain and sell in
  gross to divers of the king's subjects great quantities of wines of
  Gascony, Guienne, and French wines, some for five pounds per tonne, some
  for more and some for less, and so after the rate of excessive prices
  contrary to the effect <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> of a good and laudable statute lately
  made in this present parliament; that is to say, contrary to and above
  the prices thereof set by the Right Honourable Lord Chancellor, Lord
  Treasurer, Lord President of the King's most honourable Council, Lord
  Privy Seal, and the two Chief Justices of either bench, whereby they be
  fallen into the penalties limited by the said statute; as by due proof
  made by examination taken is well known&mdash;but also having in their
  hands great abundance of wine, by them acquired and bought to be sold,
  obstinately and maliciously, since their said attemptate and defaults
  proved, have refused to bargain and sell to many of the king's subjects
  any of their said wines remaining and being in their hands; purposing and
  intending thereby their own singular and unreasonable lucres and profits,
  to have larger and higher prices of their said wines, to be set according
  to their insatiable appetites and minds; it is therefore ordained and
  enacted, by authority of this present parliament, that every merchant now
  having, or which shall hereafter have, wines to be sold, and refusing to
  sell or deliver, or not selling and delivering any of the said wines for
  ready money therefore to be paid, according to the price or prices
  thereof being set, shall forfeit and lose the value of the wine so
  required to be bought.... For due execution of which provision, and for
  the relief of the king's subjects, it shall be lawful to all and singular
  justices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and other head officers in
  shires, cities, boroughs, towns, etc., at the request of any person to
  whom the said merchant or merchants have refused to sell, to enter into
  the cellars and other places where such wines shall lie or be, and to
  sell and deliver the same wine or wines desired to be bought to the
  person or persons requiring to buy the same; taking of the buyer of the
  wine so sold to the use and satisfaction of the proprietor aforesaid,
  according to the prices determined by the law."</p>

  <p>The next which I select is the eleventh of the second and third of
  Philip and Mary; and falling in the midst of the smoke of the Smithfield
  fires, and the cruelties of that melancholy time, it shines like a fair
  gleam of humanity, which will not lose anything of its lustre because the
  evils against which it contends have in our times, also, furnished matter
  for sorrow and calamity&mdash;calamity which we unhappily have been
  unable even to attempt to remedy. It is termed "An Act touching Weavers,"
  and runs:</p>

  <p>"Forasmuch as the weavers of this realm have, as well at <!-- Page 37
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span> this present
  parliament as at divers other times, complained that the rich and wealthy
  clothiers do in many ways oppress them&mdash;some by setting up and
  keeping in their houses divers looms, and keeping and maintaining them by
  journeymen and persons unskilful, to the decay of a great number of
  artificers which were brought up in the said science of weaving, with
  their families and their households&mdash;some by engrossing of looms
  into their hands and possession, and letting them out at such
  unreasonable rents, as the poor artificers are not able to maintain
  themselves, much less maintain their wives, families, and
  children&mdash;some also by giving much less wages and hire for weaving
  and workmanship than in times past they did, whereby they are enforced
  utterly to forsake their art and occupation wherein they have been
  brought up; It is, therefore, for remedy of the premises, and for the
  avoiding of a great number of inconveniences which may grow if in time it
  be not foreseen, ordained and enacted by authority of this present
  parliament, that no person using the feat or mystery of cloth-making, and
  dwelling out of a city, borough, market-town, or corporate town, shall
  keep, or retain, or have in his or their houses or possession, any more
  than one woollen loom at a time; nor shall by any means, directly or
  indirectly, receive or take any manner of profit, gain, or commodity, by
  letting or setting any loom, or any house wherein any loom is or shall be
  used or occupied, which shall be together by him set or let, upon pain of
  forfeiture for every week that any person shall do the contrary to the
  tenor and true meaning hereof, twenty shillings."</p>

  <p>A provision then follows, limiting weavers living in towns to two
  looms&mdash;the plain intention being to prevent the cloth manufacture
  from falling into the power of large capitalists employing "hands;" and
  to enable as many persons as possible to earn all in their own homes
  their own separate independent living. I suppose that the parliament was
  aware that by pursuing this policy the cost of production was something
  increased; that cloth was thus made dearer than it would have been if
  trade had been left to follow its own course. It considered, however,
  that the loss was compensated to the nation by retaining its people in
  the condition not of "hands," but of men; by rendering them independent
  of masters, who only sought to make their own advantage at the expense of
  labour; and enabling them to continue to maintain themselves in manly
  freedom. The weak point of all such provisions did not lie, I think, in
  the economic aspect of them, but in a far deeper difficulty. The details
  of <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>[pg
  38]</span> trade legislation, it is obvious, could only be determined by
  persons professionally conversant with those details; and the
  indispensable condition of success with such legislation is, that it be
  conducted under the highest sense of the obligations of honesty. No laws
  are of any service which are above the working level of public morality;
  and the deeper they are carried down into life, the larger become the
  opportunities of evasion. That the system succeeded for centuries is
  evident from the organisation of the companies remaining so long in its
  vitality; but the efficiency of this organisation for the maintenance of
  fair dealing could exist only so long as the companies
  themselves&mdash;their wardens and their other officials, who alone,
  <i>quisque in suâ arte</i>, were competent to judge what was right and
  what was wrong&mdash;could be trusted, at the same time being interested
  parties, to give a disinterested judgment. The largeness of the power
  inevitably committed to the councils was at once a temptation and an
  opportunity to abuse those powers; and slowly through the statute book we
  find the traces of the poison as it crept in and in. Already in the 24th
  of Henry VIII., we meet with complaints in the leather trade of the
  fraudulent conduct of the searchers, whose duty was to affix their seal
  upon leather ascertained to be sound, before it was exposed for sale,
  "which mark or print, for corruption and lucre, is commonly set and put
  by such as take upon them the search and sealing, as well upon leather
  insufficiently tanned, as upon leather well tanned, to the great deceit
  of the buyers thereof." About the same time, the "craft wardens" of the
  various fellowships, "out of sinister mind and purpose," were levying
  excessive fees on the admission of apprentices; and when parliament
  interfered to bring them to order, they "compassed and practised by
  cautill and subtle means to delude the good and wholesome statutes passed
  for remedy."<a name="NtA_64"></a><a href="#Nt_64"><sup>64</sup></a> The
  old proverb, <i>Quis custodiat custodes</i>, had begun to verify itself,
  and the symptom was a fatal one. These evils, for the first half of the
  century, remained within compass; but as we pass on we find them
  increasing steadily. In the 7th and the 8th of Elizabeth, there are
  indications of the truck system; and towards her later years, the
  multiplying statutes and growing complaints and difficulties show plainly
  that the companies had lost their healthy vitality, and, with other
  relics of feudalism, were fast taking themselves away. There were no
  longer tradesmen to be found in sufficient numbers who were possessed of
  the necessary <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> probity; and it is impossible not to
  connect such a phenomenon with the deep melancholy which in those years
  settled down on Elizabeth herself.</p>

  <p>For, indeed, a change was coming upon the world, the meaning and
  direction of which even still is hidden from us, a change from era to
  era. The paths trodden by the footsteps of ages were broken up; old
  things were passing away, and the faith and the life of ten centuries
  were dissolving like a dream. Chivalry was dying; the abbey and the
  castle were soon together to crumble into ruins; and all the forms,
  desires, beliefs, convictions of the old world were passing away, never
  to return. A new continent had risen up beyond the western sea. The floor
  of heaven, inlaid with stars, had sunk back into an infinite abyss of
  immeasurable space; and the firm earth itself, unfixed from its
  foundations, was seen to be but a small atom in the awful vastness of the
  universe. In the fabric of habit in which they had so laboriously built
  for themselves, mankind were to remain no longer.</p>

  <p>And now it is all gone&mdash;like an unsubstantial pageant faded; and
  between us and the old English there lies a gulf of mystery which the
  prose of the historian will never adequately bridge. They cannot come to
  us, and our imagination can but feebly penetrate to them. Only among the
  aisles of the cathedral, only as we gaze upon their silent figures
  sleeping on their tombs, some faint conceptions float before us of what
  these men were when they were alive; and perhaps in the sound of church
  bells, that peculiar creation of mediæval age, which falls upon the ear
  like the echo of a vanished world.</p>

  <p>The transition out of this old state is what in this book I have
  undertaken to relate. As yet there were uneasy workings below the
  surface; but the crust was unbroken, and the nation remained outwardly
  unchanged as it had been for centuries. I have still some few features to
  add to my description.</p>

  <p>Nothing, I think, proves more surely the mutual confidence which held
  together the government and the people, than the fact that all classes
  were armed. Every man, as I have already said, was a soldier; and every
  man was ready equipped at all times with the arms which corresponded to
  his rank. By the great statute of Winchester,<a name="NtA_65"></a><a
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>65</sup></a> which was repeated and expanded on many
  occasions in the after reigns, it was enacted, "That every man have
  harness in his house to keep the peace after the antient
  assise&mdash;that is to say, every man between <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> fifteen years of age
  and sixty years shall be assessed and sworn to armour according to the
  quantity of his lands and goods&mdash;that is, to wit, for fifteen pounds
  lands and forty marks goods, a hauberke, a helmet of iron, a sword, a
  dagger, and a horse. For ten pounds of lands and twenty marks goods, a
  hauberke, a helmet, a sword, and a dagger. For five pounds lands, a
  doublet, a helmet of iron, a sword, and a dagger. For forty shillings
  lands, a sword, a bow and arrows, and a dagger. And all others that may
  shall have bows and arrows. Review of armour shall be made every year two
  times, by two constables for every hundred and franchise thereunto
  appointed; and the constables shall present, to justices assigned for
  that purpose, such defaults as they do find."</p>

  <p>As the archery was more developed, and the bow became the peculiar
  weapon of the English, regular practice was ordered, and shooting became
  at once the drill and the amusement of the people. Every hamlet had its
  pair of butts; and on Sundays and holidays<a name="NtA_66"></a><a
  href="#Nt_66"><sup>66</sup></a> all able-bodied men were required to
  appear in the field, to employ their leisure hours "as valyant Englishmen
  ought to do," "utterly leaving the play at the bowls, quoits, dice,
  kails, and other unthrifty games;" magistrates, mayors, and bailiffs
  being responsible for their obedience, under penalty, if these officers
  neglected their duty, of a fine of twenty shillings for each offence. On
  the same days, the tilt-yard at the Hall or Castle was thrown open, and
  the young men of rank amused themselves with similar exercises. Fighting,
  or mock fighting&mdash;and the imitation was not unlike the
  reality&mdash;was at once the highest enjoyment and the noblest
  accomplishment of all ranks in the state; and over that most terrible of
  human occupations they had flung the enchanted halo of chivalry,
  decorating it with all the fairest graces, and consecrating it with the
  most heroic aspirations.</p>

  <p>The chivalry, with much else, was often perhaps something ideal. In
  the wars of the Roses it had turned into mere savage ferocity; and in
  forty years of carnage the fighting propensities had glutted themselves.
  A reaction followed, and in the early years of Henry VIII. the statutes
  were growing obsolete, and the "unlawful games" rising again into favour.
  The younger nobles, or some among them, were shrinking from the
  tilt-yard, and were backward on occasions even when required for war.
  Lord Surrey, when waiting on the Border, expecting the Duke of Albany to
  invade the northern counties, in 1523, complained <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> of the growing
  "slowness" of the young lords "to be at such journeys,"<a
  name="NtA_67"></a><a href="#Nt_67"><sup>67</sup></a> and of their
  "inclination to dancing, carding, and dicing." The people had followed
  the example, and were falling out of archery practice, exchanging it for
  similar amusements. Henry VIII., in his earlier days an Englishman after
  the old type, set himself resolutely to oppose these downward tendencies,
  and to brace again the slackened sinews of the nation. In his own person
  he was the best rider, the best lance, and the best archer in England;
  and while a boy he was dreaming of fresh Agincourts, and even of fresh
  crusades. In 1511, when he had been king only three years, parliament
  re-enacted the Winchester statute, with new and remarkable provisions;
  and twice subsequently in the course of his reign he returned back upon
  the subject, insisting upon it with increasing stringency. The language
  of the Act of 1511 is not a little striking. "The King's Highness," so
  the words run, "calling to his gracious remembrance that by the feats and
  exercise of the subjects of his realm in shooting in long bows, there had
  continually grown and been within the same great numbers and multitudes
  of good archers, which hath not only defended the realm and the subjects
  thereof against the cruel malice and dangers of their enemies in times
  heretofore past, but also, with little numbers and puissance in regard of
  their opposites, have done many notable acts and discomfitures of war
  against the infidels and others; and furthermore reduced divers regions
  and countries to their due obeysance, to the great honour, fame, and
  surety of this realm and subjects, and to the terrible dread and fear of
  all strange nations, anything to attempt or do to the hurt or damage of
  them: Yet nevertheless that archery and shooting in long bows is but
  little used, but daily does minish and decay, and abate more and more;
  for that much part of the commonalty and poor people of this realm,
  whereby of old time the great number and substance of archers had grown
  and multiplied, be not of power nor ability to buy them long bows of yew
  to exercise shooting in the same, and to sustain the continual charge
  thereof; and also because, by means and occasions of customable usage of
  tennis play, bowles, claish and other unlawful games, prohibited by many
  good and beneficent statutes, much impoverishment hath ensued: Wherefore,
  the King's Highness, of his great wisdom and providence, and also for
  zeal to the public weal, surety, and defence of this his realm, and the
  antient fame in this behalf to be revived, by <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> the assent of his
  Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and his Commons in this present parliament
  assembled, hath enacted and established that the statute of Winchester
  for archers be put in due execution; and over that, that every man being
  the king's subject, not lame, decrepit, or maimed, being within the age
  of sixty years, except spiritual men, justices of the one bench and of
  the other, justices of the assize, and barons of the exchequer, do use
  and exercise shooting in long bows, and also do have a bow and arrows
  ready continually in his house, to use himself in shooting. And that
  every man having a man child or men children in his house, shall provide
  for all such, being of the age of seven years and above, and till they
  shall come to the age of seventeen years, a bow and two shafts, to learn
  them and bring them up in shooting; and after such young men shall come
  to the age of seventeen years, every of them shall provide and have a bow
  and four arrows continually for himself, at his proper costs and charges,
  or else of the gift and provision of his friends, and shall use the same
  as afore is rehearsed." Other provisions are added, designed to suppress
  the games complained of, and to place the bows more within the reach of
  the poor, by cheapening the prices of them.</p>

  <p>The same statute<a name="NtA_68"></a><a
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>68</sup></a> (and if this be a proof that it had
  imperfectly succeeded, it is a proof also of Henry's confidence in the
  general attachment of his subjects) was re-enacted thirty years later, at
  the crisis of the Reformation, when the northern counties were fermenting
  in a half-suppressed rebellion, and the catholics at home and abroad were
  intriguing to bring about a revolution. In this subsequent edition of
  it<a name="NtA_69"></a><a href="#Nt_69"><sup>69</sup></a> some
  particulars are added which demand notice. In the directions to the
  villages for the maintaining each "a pair of buttes," it is ordered that
  no person above the age of twenty-four shall shoot with the light flight
  arrow at a distance under two hundred and twenty yards. Up to two hundred
  and twenty yards, therefore, the heavy war arrow was used, and this is to
  be taken as the effective range for fighting purposes of the old
  archery.<a name="NtA_70"></a><a href="#Nt_70"><sup>70</sup></a> <!-- Page
  43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> No
  measures could have been invented more effective than this vigorous
  arming to repress the self-seeking tendencies in the mercantile classes
  which I have mentioned as beginning to show themselves. Capital supported
  by force may make its own terms with labour; but capital lying between a
  king on one side resolved to prevent oppression, and a people on the
  other side in full condition to resist, felt even prudence dictate
  moderation, and reserved itself for a more convenient season.</p>

  <p>Looking, therefore, at the state of England as a whole, I cannot doubt
  that under Henry the body of the people were prosperous, well-fed, loyal,
  and contented. In all points of material comfort they were as well off as
  they had ever been before; better off than they have ever been in later
  times.</p>

  <p>Their amusements, as prescribed by statute, consisted in training
  themselves as soldiers. In the prohibitions of the statutes we see also
  what their amusements were inclined to be. But besides "the bowles and
  the claish," field sports, fishing, shooting, hunting, were the delight
  of every one, and although the forest laws were terrible, they served
  only to enhance the excitement by danger. Then, as now, no English
  peasant could be convinced that there was any moral crime in
  appropriating the wild game. It was an offence against statute law, but
  no offence against natural law; and it was rather a trial of skill
  between the noble who sought to monopolise a right which seemed to be
  common to all, and those who would succeed, if they could, in securing
  their own share of it. The Robin Hood ballads reflect the popular feeling
  and breathe the warm genial spirit of the old greenwood adventurers. If
  deer-stealing was a sin, it was more than compensated by the risk of the
  penalty to which those who failed submitted, when no other choice was
  left. They did not always submit, as the old northern poem shows of
  <i>Adam Bell, Clym of the Clough, and William of Cloudislee</i>, with its
  most immoral moral; yet I suppose there was never pedant who could resist
  the spell <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>[pg
  44]</span> of those ringing lines, or refuse with all his heart to wish
  the rogues success, and confusion to the honest men.</p>

  <p>But the English peasantry had pleasures of less ambiguous propriety,
  and less likely to mislead our sympathies. The chroniclers have given us
  many accounts of the masques and plays which were acted in the court, or
  in the castles of the noblemen. Such pageants were but the most splendid
  expression of a taste which was national and universal. As in ancient
  Greece, generations before the rise of the great dramas of Athens,
  itinerant companies wandered from village to village, carrying their
  stage furniture in their little carts, and acted in their booths and
  tents the grand stories of the mythology; so in England the mystery
  players haunted the wakes and fairs, and in barns or taverns, taprooms,
  or in the farmhouse kitchen, played at saints and angels, and transacted
  on their petty stage the drama of the Christian faith. To us, who can
  measure the effect of such scenes only by the impression which they would
  now produce upon ourselves, these exhibitions can seem but unspeakably
  profane; they were not profane when tendered in simplicity, and received
  as they were given. They were no more profane than those quaint monastic
  illuminations which formed the germ of Italian art; and as out of the
  illuminations arose those paintings which remain unapproached and
  unapproachable in their excellence, so out of the mystery plays arose the
  English drama, represented in its final completeness by the creations of
  a poet who, it now begins to be supposed, stands alone among mankind. We
  allow ourselves to think of Shakspeare or of Raphael or of Phidias, as
  having accomplished their work by the power of their own individual
  genius; but greatness like theirs is never more than the highest degree
  of an excellence which prevails widely round it, and forms the
  environment in which it grows. No single mind in single contact with the
  facts of nature could have created out of itself a Pallas, a Madonna, or
  a Lear; such vast conceptions are the growth of ages, the creations of a
  nation's spirit; and artist and poet, filled full with the power of that
  spirit, have but given them form, and nothing more than form. Nor would
  the form itself have been attainable by any isolated talent. No genius
  can dispense with experience; the aberrations of power, unguided or
  ill-guided, are ever in proportion to its intensity, and life is not long
  enough to recover from inevitable mistakes. Noble conceptions already
  existing, and a noble school of execution which will launch mind and hand
  at once upon their true courses, are indispensable <!-- Page 45 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> to transcendent
  excellence; and Shakspeare's plays were as much the offspring of the long
  generations who had pioneered his road for him, as the discoveries of
  Newton were the offspring of those of Copernicus.</p>

  <p>No great general ever arose out of a nation of cowards; no great
  statesman or philosopher out of a nation of fools; no great artist out of
  a nation of materialists; no great dramatist except when the drama was
  the passion of the people. Acting was the especial amusement of the
  English, from the palace to the village green. It was the result and
  expression of their power over themselves, and power over circumstances.
  They were troubled with no subjective speculations; no social problems
  vexed them with which they were unable to deal; and in the exuberance of
  vigour and spirits they were able, in the strict and literal sense of the
  word, to play with the materials of life. The mystery plays came first;
  next the popular legends; and then the great figures of English history
  came out upon the stage, or stories from Greek and Roman writers; or
  sometimes it was an extemporised allegory. Shakspeare himself has left us
  many pictures of the village drama. Doubtless he had seen many a Bottom
  in the old Warwickshire hamlets; many a Sir Nathaniel playing
  "Alissander," and finding himself "a little o'erparted." He had been with
  Snug the joiner, Quince the carpenter, and Flute the bellows-mender, when
  a boy we will not question, and acted with them, and written their parts
  for them; had gone up with them in the winter's evenings to the Lucy's
  Hall before the sad trouble with the deer-stealing; and afterwards, when
  he came to London and found his way into great society, he had not failed
  to see Polonius burlesquing Cæsar on the stage, as in his proper person
  Polonius burlesqued Sir William Cecil. The strolling players in
  <i>Hamlet</i> might be met at every country wake or festival; it was the
  direction in which the especial genius of the people delighted to revel.
  As I desire in this chapter not only to relate what were the habits of
  the people, but to illustrate them also, within such compass as I can
  allow myself, I shall transcribe out of Hall<a name="NtA_71"></a><a
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>71</sup></a> a description of a play which was acted
  by the boys of St. Paul's School, in 1527, at Greenwich, adding some
  particulars, not mentioned by Hall, from another source.<a
  name="NtA_72"></a><a href="#Nt_72"><sup>72</sup></a> It is a good
  instance of the fantastic splendour with which exhibitions of this kind
  were <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>[pg
  46]</span> got up, and it possesses also a melancholy interest of another
  kind, as showing how little the wisest among us can foresee our own
  actions, or assure ourselves that the convictions of to-day will alike be
  the convictions of to-morrow. The occasion was the despatch of a French
  embassy to England, when Europe was outraged by the Duke of Bourbon's
  capture of Rome, when the children of Francis I. were prisoners in Spain,
  and Henry, with the full energy of his fiery nature, was flinging himself
  into a quarrel with Charles V. as the champion of the Holy See.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of a magnificent supper "the king led the
  ambassadors into the great chamber of disguisings; and in the end of the
  same chamber was a fountain, and on one side was a hawthorne tree, all of
  silk, with white flowers, and on the other side was a mulberry tree full
  of fair berries, all of silk. On the top of the hawthorne were the arms
  of England, compassed with the collar of the order<a name="NtA_73"></a><a
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>73</sup></a> of St. Michael, and in the top of the
  mulberry tree stood the arms of France within a garter. The fountain was
  all of white marble, graven and chased; the bases of the same were balls
  of gold, supported by ramping beasts wound in leaves of gold. In the
  first work were gargoylles of gold, fiercely faced with spouts running.
  The second receit of this fountain was environed with winged serpents,
  all of gold, which griped it; and on the summit of the same was a fair
  lady, out of whose breasts ran abundantly water of marvellous delicious
  savour. About this fountain were benches of rosemary, fretted in braydes
  laid on gold, all the sides set with roses, on branches as they were
  growing about this fountain. On the benches sate eight fair ladies in
  strange attire, and so richly apparelled in cloth of gold, embroidered
  and cut over silver, that I cannot express the cunning workmanship
  thereof. Then when the king and queen were set, there was played before
  them, by children, in the Latin tongue, a manner of tragedy, the effect
  whereof was that the pope was in captivity and the church brought under
  foot. Whereupon St. Peter appeared and put the cardinal (Wolsey) in
  authority to bring the pope to his liberty, and to set up the church
  again. And so the cardinal made intercession with the kings of England
  and France that they took part together, and by their means the pope was
  delivered. Then in came the French king's children, and complained to the
  cardinal how the emperour kept them as hostages, and would not come to
  reasonable point with their <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> father, whereupon they desired the
  cardinal to help for their deliverance; which wrought so with the king
  his master and the French king that he brought the emperour to a peace,
  and caused the two young princes to be delivered." So far Hall relates
  the scene, but there was more in the play than he remembered or cared to
  notice, and I am able to complete this curious picture of a pageant once
  really and truly a living spectacle in the old palace at Greenwich, by an
  inventory of the dresses worn by the boys and a list of the <i>dramatis
  personæ</i>.</p>

  <p>The school-boys of St. Paul's were taken down the river with the
  master in six boats, at the cost of a shilling a boat&mdash;the cost of
  the dresses and the other expenses amounting in all to sixty-one
  shillings.</p>

  <p>The characters were&mdash;</p>

  <p>An orator in apparel of cloth of gold.</p>

  <p>Religio, Ecclesia, Veritas, like three widows, in garments of silk,
  and suits of lawn and Cyprus.</p>

  <p>Heresy and False Interpretation, like sisters of Bohemia, apparelled
  in silk of divers colours.</p>

  <p>The heretic Luther, like a party friar, in russet damask and black
  taffety.</p>

  <p>Luther's wife, like a frow of Spiers in Almayn, in red silk.</p>

  <p>Peter, Paul, and James, in habits of white sarsnet, and three red
  mantles, and lace of silver and damask, and pelisses of scarlet.</p>

  <p>A Cardinal in his apparel.</p>

  <p>Two Sergeants in rich apparel.</p>

  <p>The Dolphin and his brother in coats of velvet embroidered with gold,
  and capes of satin bound with velvet.</p>

  <p>A Messenger in tinsel satin.</p>

  <p>Six men in gowns of grey sarsnet.</p>

  <p>Six women in gowns of crimson velvet.</p>

  <p>War, in rich cloth of gold and feathers, armed.</p>

  <p>Three Almeyns, in apparel all cut and holed in silk.</p>

  <p>Lady Peace in lady's apparel white and rich.</p>

  <p>Lady Quietness and Dame Tranquillity richly beseen in lady's
  apparel.</p>

  <p>It is a strange world. This was in November, 1527. In November, 1530,
  but three brief years after, Wolsey lay dying in misery, a disgraced man,
  at Leicester Abbey; "the Pope's Holiness" was fast becoming in English
  eyes plain Bishop of Rome, held guilty towards this realm of unnumbered
  enormities, <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> and all England was sweeping with
  immeasurable velocity towards the heretic Luther. So history repeats the
  lesson to us, not to boast ourselves of the morrow, for we know not what
  a day may bring forth.</p>

  <p>Before I conclude this survey, it remains for me to say something of
  the position of the poor, and of the measures which were taken for the
  solution of that most difficult of all problems, the distinguishing the
  truly deserving from the worthless and the vagabond. The subject is one
  to which in the progress of this work I shall have more than one occasion
  to return; but inasmuch as a sentimental opinion prevails that an
  increase of poverty and the consequent enactment of poor-laws was the
  result of the suppression of the religious houses, and that adequate
  relief had been previously furnished by these establishments, it is
  necessary to say a few words for the removal of an impression which is as
  near as possible the reverse of the truth. I do not doubt that for many
  centuries these houses fulfilled honestly the intentions with which they
  were established; but as early as the reign of Richard II. it was found
  necessary to provide some other means for the support of the aged and
  impotent; the monasteries not only having then begun to neglect their
  duty; but by the appropriation of benefices having actually deprived the
  parishes of their local and independent means of charity.<a
  name="NtA_74"></a><a href="#Nt_74"><sup>74</sup></a> Licences to beg were
  at that time granted to deserving persons; and it is noticeable that this
  measure was in a few years followed by the petition to Henry IV. for the
  secularisation of ecclesiastical property.<a name="NtA_75"></a><a
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>75</sup></a> Thus early in our history had the regular
  clergy forgotten the nature of their mission, and the object for which
  the administration of the nation's charities had been committed to them.
  Thus early, while their houses were the nurseries of dishonest
  mendicancy,<a name="NtA_76"></a><a href="#Nt_76"><sup>76</sup></a> they
  had surrendered to lay compassion, those who ought to have been their
  especial care. I shall unhappily have occasion hereafter to illustrate
  these matters in detail. I mention them in this place only in order to
  dissipate at once a foolish dream. At the opening of the sixteenth
  century, before the suppression of the monasteries had suggested itself
  in a practical form, pauperism was a state question of great difficulty,
  and as such I have at present to consider it.</p>

  <p>For the able-bodied vagrant, it is well known that the old <!-- Page
  49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> English
  laws had no mercy. When wages are low, and population has outgrown the
  work which can be provided for it, idleness may be involuntary and
  innocent; at a time when all industrious men could maintain themselves in
  comfort and prosperity, "when a fair day's wages for a fair day's work"
  was really and truly the law of the land, it was presumed that if strong
  capable men preferred to wander about the country, and live upon the
  labour of others, mendicancy was not the only crime of which they were
  likely to be guilty; while idleness itself was justly looked upon as a
  high offence, and misdemeanour. The penalty of God's laws against
  idleness, as expressed in the system of nature, was starvation; and it
  was held intolerable that any man should be allowed to escape a divine
  judgment by begging under false pretences, and robbing others of their
  honest earnings.</p>

  <p>In a country also the boast of which was its open-handed hospitality,
  it was necessary to take care that hospitality was not brought to
  discredit by abuse; and when every door was freely opened to a request
  for a meal or a night's lodging, there was an imperative duty to keep a
  strict eye on whatever persons were on the move. We shall therefore be
  prepared to find "sturdy and valiant beggars" treated with summary
  justice as criminals of a high order; the right of a government so to
  treat them being proportioned to the facilities with which the honestly
  disposed can maintain themselves.</p>

  <p>It might have been expected, on the other hand, that when wages were
  so high, and work so constant, labourers would have been left to
  themselves to make provision against sickness and old age. To modern ways
  of thinking on these subjects, there would have seemed no hardship in so
  leaving them; and their sufferings, if they had suffered, would have
  appeared but as a deserved retribution. This, however, was not the temper
  of earlier times. Charity has ever been the especial virtue of Catholic
  States, and the aged and the impotent were always held to be the
  legitimate objects of it. Men who had worked hard while they were able to
  work were treated like decayed soldiers, as the discharged pensionaries
  of society; they were held entitled to wear out their age (under
  restrictions) at the expense of others; and so readily did society
  acquiesce in this aspect of its obligations, that on the failure of the
  monasteries to do their duty, it was still sufficient to leave such
  persons to voluntary liberality, and legislation had to interfere only to
  direct such liberality into its legitimate channels. In the <!-- Page 50
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> 23rd of Edw.
  III. cap. 7, a prohibition was issued against giving alms to "valiant
  beggars," and this proving inadequate, and charity being still given
  indiscriminately, in the twelfth year of Richard II. the system of
  licences was introduced, and a pair of stocks was erected by order in
  every town or village, to "justify" persons begging unpermitted. The
  monasteries growing more and more careless, the number of paupers
  continued to multiply, and this method received successive expansions,
  till at length, when the Reformation was concluded, it terminated, after
  many changes of form, in the famous Act of Elizabeth. We can thus trace
  our poor law in the whole course of its growth, and into two stages
  through which it passed I must enter with some minuteness. The 12th of
  the 22nd of Henry VIII., and the 25th of the 27th, are so remarkable in
  their tone, and so rich in their detail, as to furnish a complete
  exposition of English thought at that time upon the subject; while the
  second of these two acts, and probably the first also, has a further
  interest for us, as being the composition of Henry himself, and the most
  finished which he has left to us.<a name="NtA_77"></a><a
  href="#Nt_77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Whereas," says the former of these two Acts, "in all places
  throughout this realm of England, vagabonds and beggars have of long time
  increased, and daily do increase in great and excessive numbers, by the
  occasion of idleness, mother and root of all vices; whereby hath insurged
  and sprung, and daily insurgeth and springeth, continual thefts, murders,
  and other heinous offences and great enormities, to the high displeasure
  of God, the inquietation and damage of the king's people, and to the
  marvellous disturbance of the common weal of this realm; and whereas,
  strait statutes and ordinances have been before this time devised and
  made, as well by the king our sovereign lord, as also by divers his most
  noble progenitors, kings of England, for the most necessary and due
  reformation of the premises; yet that notwithstanding, the said number of
  vagabonds and beggars be not seen in any part to be diminished, but
  rather daily augmented and increased into great routs or companies, as
  evidently and manifestly it doth and may appear: Be it therefore enacted
  by the king our sovereign lord, and by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
  and the Commons, in this present parliament assembled, that the justices
  of the peace of all and singular the shires of England within the limits
  of their commission, and all other justices of the peace, mayors,
  sheriffs, <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[pg
  51]</span> bailiffs, and other officers of every city, borough, or
  franchise, shall from time to time, as often as need shall require, make
  diligent search and inquiry of all aged, poor, and impotent persons,
  which live, or of necessity be compelled to live by alms of the charity
  of the people; and such search made, the said officers, every of them
  within the limits of their authorities, shall have power, at their
  discretions, to enable to beg within such limits as they shall appoint,
  such of the said impotent persons as they shall think convenient; and to
  give in commandment to every such impotent beggar (by them enabled) that
  none of them shall beg without the limits so appointed to them. And
  further, they shall deliver to every such person so enabled a letter
  containing the name of that person, witnessing that he is authorised to
  beg, and the limits within which he is appointed to beg, the same letter
  to be sealed with the seal of the hundred, rape, wapentake, city, or
  borough, and subscribed with the name of one of the said justices or
  officers aforesaid. And if any such impotent person do beg in any other
  place than within such limits, then the justices of the peace, and all
  other the king's officers and ministers, shall by their discretions
  punish all such persons by imprisonment in the stocks, by the space of
  two days and two nights, giving them only bread and water."</p>

  <p>Further, "If any such impotent person be found begging without a
  licence, at the discretion of the justices of the peace, he shall be
  stripped naked from the middle upwards, and whipped within the town in
  which he be found, or within some other town, as it shall seem good. Or
  if it be not convenient so to punish him, he shall be set in the stocks
  by the space of three days and three nights."</p>

  <p>Such were the restrictions under which impotency was allowed support.
  Though not in itself treated as an offence, and though its right to
  maintenance by society was not denied, it was not indulged, as we may
  see, with unnecessary encouragement. The Act then proceeds to deal with
  the genuine vagrant.</p>

  <p>"And be it further enacted, that if any person or persons, being whole
  and mighty in body and able to labour, be taken in begging in any part of
  this realm; and if any man or woman, being whole and mighty in body,
  having no land, nor master, nor using any lawful merchandry, craft, or
  mystery whereby he might get his living, be vagrant, and can give none
  account how he doth lawfully get his living, then it shall, be lawful to
  the constables and all other king's officers, ministers, and <!-- Page 52
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> subjects of
  every town, parish, and hamlet, to arrest the said vagabonds and idle
  persons, and bring them to any justice of the peace of the same shire or
  liberty, or else to the high constable of the hundred; and the justice of
  the peace, high constable, or other officer, shall cause such idle person
  so to him brought, to be had to the next market town or other place, and
  there to be tied to the end of a cart, naked, and be beaten with whips
  throughout the same town till his body be bloody by reason of such
  whipping; and after such punishment of whipping had, the person so
  punished shall be enjoined upon his oath to return forthwith without
  delay, in the next and straight way, to the place where he was born, or
  where he last dwelled before the same punishment, by the space of three
  years; and then put himself to labour like a true man ought to do; and
  after that done, every such person so punished and ordered shall have a
  letter, sealed with the seal of the hundred, rape, or wapentake,
  witnessing that he hath been punished according to this estatute, and
  containing the day and place of his punishment, and the place where unto
  he is limited to go, and by what time he is limited to come thither: for
  that within that time, showing the said letter, he may lawfully beg by
  the way, and otherwise not; and if he do not accomplish the order to him
  appointed by the said letter, then to be eftsoons taken and whipped; and
  so often as there be fault found in him, to be whipped till he has his
  body put to labour for his living, or otherwise truly get his living, so
  long as he is able to do so."</p>

  <p>Then follow the penalties against the justices of the peace,
  constables, and all officers who neglect to arrest such persons; and a
  singularly curious catalogue is added of certain forms of "sturdy
  mendicancy," which, if unspecified, might have been passed over as
  exempt, but to which Henry had no intention of conceding further licence.
  It seems as if, in framing the Act, he had Simon Fish's petition before
  him, and was commencing at last the rough remedy of the cart's-tail,
  which Fish had dared to recommend for a very obdurate evil.<a
  name="NtA_78"></a><a href="#Nt_78"><sup>78</sup></a> The friars of the
  mendicant orders were tolerated for a few years longer; but <!-- Page 53
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> many other
  spiritual persons may have suffered seriously under the provisions of the
  present statute.</p>

  <p>"Be it further enacted," the Act continues, "that scholars of the
  Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, that go about begging, not being
  authorised under the seal of the said universities, by the commissary,
  chancellor, or vice-chancellor of the same; and that all and singular
  shipmen pretending losses of their ships and goods, going about the
  country begging without sufficient authority, shall be punished and
  ordered in manner and form as is above rehearsed of strong beggars; and
  that all proctors and pardoners, and all other idle persons going about
  in counties or abiding in any town, city, or borough, some of them using
  divers subtle, crafty, and unlawful games and plays, and some of them
  feigning themselves to have knowledge in physick, physnamye, and
  palmistry, or other crafty science, whereby they bear the people in hand
  that they can tell their destinies, dreams, and fortunes, and such other
  like fantastical imaginations, to the great deceit of the king's
  subjects, shall, upon examination had before two justices of the peace,
  if by provable witness they be found guilty of such deceits, be punished
  by whipping at two days together, after the manner before rehearsed. And
  if they eftsoons offend in the same or any like offence, to be scourged
  two days, and the third day to be put upon the pillory, from nine o'clock
  till eleven the forenoon of the same day, and to have the right ear cut
  off; and if they offend the third time, to have like punishment with
  whipping and the pillory, and to have the other ear cut off."</p>

  <p>It would scarcely have been expected that this Act would have failed
  for want of severity in its penalties; yet five years later, for this and
  for some other reasons, it was thought desirable to expand the provisions
  of it, enhancing the penalties at the same time to a degree which has
  given a bloody name in the history of English law to the statutes of
  Henry VIII. Of this expanded statute<a name="NtA_79"></a><a
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>79</sup></a> we have positive evidence, as I said,
  that Henry was himself the author. The merit of it, or the guilt of
  it&mdash;if guilt there be&mdash;originated with him alone. The early
  clauses contain practical amendments of an undoubtedly salutary kind. The
  Act of 1531 had been defective in that no specified means had been
  assigned for finding vagrants in labour, which, with men of broken
  character, was not immediately easy. The smaller monasteries having been
  suppressed in the interval, and sufficient funds being thus placed <!--
  Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> at
  the disposal of the government, public works<a name="NtA_80"></a><a
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>80</sup></a> were set on foot throughout the kingdom,
  and this difficulty was obviated.</p>

  <p>Another important alteration was a restriction upon private charity.
  Private persons were forbidden, under heavy penalties, to give money to
  beggars, whether deserving or undeserving. The poor of each parish might
  call at houses within the boundaries for broken meats; but this was the
  limit of personal almsgiving; and the money which men might be disposed
  to offer was to be collected by the churchwardens on Sundays and holidays
  in the churches. The parish priest was to keep an account of receipts and
  of expenditure, and relief was administered with some approach to modern
  formalities. A further excellent but severe enactment empowered the
  parish officers to take up all idle children above the age of five years,
  "and appoint them to masters of husbandry or other craft or labour to be
  taught;" and if any child should refuse the service to which he was
  appointed, or run away "without cause reasonable being shown for it," he
  might be publicly whipped with rods, at the discretion of the justice of
  the peace before whom he was brought.</p>

  <p>So far, no complaint can be urged against these provisions: they
  display only that severe but true humanity, which, in offering fair and
  liberal maintenance for all who will consent to be honest, insists, not
  unjustly, that its offer shall be accepted, and that the resources of
  charity shall not be trifled away. On the clause, however, which gave to
  the Act its especial and distinguishing character, there will be large
  difference of opinion. "The sturdy vagabond," who by the earlier statute
  was condemned on his second offence to lose the whole or a part of his
  right ear, was condemned by the amended Act, if found a third time
  offending, with the mark upon him of his mutilation, "to suffer pains and
  execution of death, as a felon and as an enemy of the commonwealth." So
  the letter stands. For an able-bodied man to be caught a third time
  begging was held a crime deserving death, and the sentence was intended,
  on fit occasions, to be executed. The poor man's advantages, which I have
  estimated at so high a rate, were not purchased without drawbacks. He
  might not change his master at his will, or wander from place to place.
  He might not keep his children <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span> at his home unless he could answer for
  their time. If out of employment, preferring to be idle, he might be
  demanded for work by any master of the "craft" to which he belonged, and
  compelled to work whether he would or no. If caught begging once, being
  neither aged nor infirm, he was whipped at the cart's tail. If caught a
  second time, his ear was slit, or bored through with a hot iron. If
  caught a third time, being thereby proved to be of no use upon this
  earth, but to live upon it only to his own hurt and to that of others, he
  suffered death as a felon. So the law of England remained for sixty
  years. First drawn by Henry, it continued unrepealed through the reigns
  of Edward and of Mary, subsisting, therefore, with the deliberate
  approval of both the great parties between whom the country was divided.
  Reconsidered under Elizabeth, the same law was again formally passed; and
  it was, therefore, the expressed conviction of the English nation, that
  it was better for a man not to live at all than to live a profitless and
  worthless life. The vagabond was a sore spot upon the commonwealth, to be
  healed by wholesome discipline if the gangrene was not incurable; to be
  cut away with the knife if the milder treatment of the cart-whip failed
  to be of profit.<a name="NtA_81"></a><a
  href="#Nt_81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

  <p>A measure so extreme in its severity was partly dictated by policy.
  The state of the country was critical; and the danger from questionable
  persons traversing it unexamined and uncontrolled was greater than at
  ordinary times. But in point of justice, as well as of prudence, it
  harmonised with the iron temper of the age, and it answered well for the
  government of a fierce and powerful people, in whose hearts lay an
  intense hatred of rascality, and among whom no one need have lapsed into
  evil courses except by deliberate preference for them. The moral
  substance of the English must have been strong indeed when it admitted of
  such hardy treatment; but on the whole, the people were ruled as they
  preferred to be ruled; and if wisdom may be tested by success, the manner
  in which they passed the great crisis of the Reformation is the best
  justification of their princes.</p>

  <p>The era was great throughout Europe. The Italians of the age of
  Michael Angelo; the Spaniards who were the contemporaries <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> of Cortez;
  the Germans who shook off the pope at the call of Luther; and the
  splendid chivalry of Francis I. of France, were no common men. But they
  were all brought face to face with the same trials, and none met them as
  the English met them. The English alone never lost their self-possession;
  and if they owed something to fortune in their escape from anarchy, they
  owed more to the strong hand and steady purpose of their rulers.</p>

  <p>To conclude this chapter then.</p>

  <p>In the brief review of the system under which England was governed, we
  have seen a state of things in which the principles of political economy
  were, consciously or unconsciously, contradicted; where an attempt, more
  or less successful, was made to bring the production and distribution of
  wealth under the moral rule of right and wrong; and where those laws of
  supply and demand, which we are now taught to regard as immutable
  ordinances of nature, were absorbed or superseded by a higher code. It is
  necessary for me to repeat that I am not holding up the sixteenth century
  as a model which the nineteenth might safely follow. The population has
  become too large, employment has become too complicated and fluctuating,
  to admit of external control; while, in default of control, the relapse
  upon self-interest as the one motive principle is certain to ensue, and
  when it ensues is absolute in its operations. But as, even with us, these
  so-called ordinances of nature in time of war consent to be suspended,
  and duty to his country becomes with every good citizen a higher motive
  of action than the advantages which he may gain in an enemy's market; so
  it is not uncheering to look back upon a time when the nation was in a
  normal condition of militancy against social injustice; when the
  government was enabled by happy circumstances to pursue into detail a
  single and serious aim at the well-being&mdash;well-being in its widest
  sense&mdash;of all members of the commonwealth. The world, indeed, was
  not made particularly pleasant. Of liberty, in the modern sense of the
  word, of the supposed right of every man "to do what he will with his
  own" or with himself, there was no idea. To the question, if ever it was
  asked, May I not do what I will with my own? there was the brief answer,
  No man may do what is wrong, either with that which is his own or with
  that which is another's. Workmen were not allowed to take advantage of
  the scantiness of the labour market to exact extravagant wages.
  Capitalists were not allowed to drive the labourers from their holdings,
  and destroy their healthy independence. <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> The antagonism of
  interests was absorbed into a relation of which equity was something more
  than the theoretic principle, and employers and employed were alike
  amenable to a law which both were compelled to obey. The working man of
  modern times has bought the extension of his liberty at the price of his
  material comfort. The higher classes have gained in luxury what they have
  lost in power. It is not for the historian to balance advantages. His
  duty is with the facts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE LAST YEARS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF WOLSEY</h3>

  <p>Times were changed in England since the second Henry walked barefoot
  through the streets of Canterbury, and knelt while the monks flogged him
  on the pavement in the Chapter-house, doing penance for Becket's murder.
  The clergy had won the battle in the twelfth century because they
  deserved to win it. They were not free from fault and weakness, but they
  felt the meaning of their profession. Their hearts were in their vows,
  their authority was exercised more justly, more nobly, than the authority
  of the crown; and therefore, with inevitable justice, the crown was
  compelled to stoop before them. The victory was great; but, like many
  victories, it was fatal to the conquerors. It filled them full with the
  vanity of power; they forgot their duties in their privileges; and when,
  a century later, the conflict recommenced, the altering issue proved the
  altering nature of the conditions under which it was fought. The laity
  were sustained in vigour by the practical obligations of life; the clergy
  sunk under the influence of a waning religion, the administration of the
  forms of which had become their sole occupation; and as character forsook
  them, the Mortmain Act,<a name="NtA_82"></a><a
  href="#Nt_82"><sup>82</sup></a> the Acts of Premunire, and the repeatedly
  recurring Statutes of Provisors mark the successive defeats that drove
  them back from the high post of command which character alone had earned
  for them. If the Black Prince had lived, or if Richard II. had inherited
  the temper of the Plantagenets, the ecclesiastical system would have been
  spared the misfortune of a longer reprieve. Its worst abuses would have
  then terminated, and the reformation of <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> <i>doctrine</i> in
  the sixteenth century would have been left to fight its independent way
  unsupported by the moral corruption of the church from which it received
  its most powerful impetus. The nation was ready for sweeping remedies.
  The people felt little loyalty to the pope, as the language of the
  Statutes of Provisors<a name="NtA_83"></a><a
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>83</sup></a> conclusively proves, and they were
  prepared to risk the sacrilege of confiscating the estates of the
  religious houses&mdash;a complete measure of secularisation being then,
  as I have already said,<a name="NtA_84"></a><a
  href="#Nt_84"><sup>84</sup></a> the expressed desire of the House of
  Commons.<a name="NtA_85"></a><a href="#Nt_85"><sup>85</sup></a> With an
  Edward III. on the throne such a measure would very likely have been
  executed, and the course of English history would have been changed. It
  was ordered otherwise, and doubtless wisely. The church was allowed a
  hundred and fifty more years to fill full the measure of her offences,
  that she might fall only when time had laid bare the root of her
  degeneracy, and that faith and manners might be changed together.</p>

  <p>The history of the time is too imperfect to justify a positive
  conclusion. It is possible, however, that the success of the revolution
  effected by Henry IV. was due in part to a reaction in the church's
  favour; and it is certain that this prince, if he did not owe his crown
  to the support of the church, determined to conciliate it. He confirmed
  the Statutes of Provisors,<a name="NtA_86"></a><a
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>86</sup></a> but he allowed them to sink into disuse.
  He forbade the further mooting of the confiscation project; and to him is
  due the first permission of the bishops to send heretics to the stake.<a
  name="NtA_87"></a><a href="#Nt_87"><sup>87</sup></a> If English tradition
  is to be trusted, the clergy still felt insecure; and the French wars of
  Henry V. are said to have been undertaken, as we all know from
  Shakspeare, at the persuasion of Archbishop Chichele, who desired to
  distract his attention from reverting to dangerous subjects. Whether this
  be true or not, no prince of the house of Lancaster betrayed a wish to
  renew the quarrel with the church. The battle of Agincourt, the conquest
  and re-conquest of France, called off the attention of the people; while
  the rise of the Lollards, and the intrusion of speculative questions, the
  agitation of which has ever been the chief aversion of English statesmen,
  contributed to change the current; and the reforming spirit must have
  lulled before the outbreak of the wars of the Roses, or one of the two
  parties in so desperate <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> a struggle would have scarcely failed to
  have availed themselves of it. Edward IV. is said to have been lenient
  towards heresy; but his toleration, if it was more than imaginary, was
  tacit only; he never ventured to avow it. It is more likely that in the
  inveterate frenzy of those years men had no leisure to remember that
  heresy existed.</p>

  <p>The clergy were thus left undisturbed to go their own course to its
  natural end. The storm had passed over them without breaking; and they
  did not dream that it would again gather. The immunity which they enjoyed
  from the general sufferings of the civil war contributed to deceive them;
  and without anxiety for the consequences, and forgetting the significant
  warning which they had received, they sank steadily into that condition
  which is inevitable from the constitution of human nature, among men
  without faith, wealthy, powerful, and luxuriously fed, yet condemned to
  celibacy, and cut off from the common duties and common pleasures of
  ordinary life. On the return of a settled government, they were startled
  for a moment in their security; the conduct of some among them had become
  so unbearable, that even Henry VII., who inherited the Lancastrian
  sympathies, was compelled to notice it; and the following brief act was
  passed by his first parliament, proving by the very terms in which it is
  couched the existing nature of church discipline. "For the more sure and
  likely reformation," it runs, "of priests, clerks, and religious men,
  culpable, or by their demerits openly noised of incontinent living in
  their bodies, contrary to their order, be it enacted, ordained, and
  established, that it be lawful to all archbishops and bishops, and other
  ordinaries having episcopal jurisdiction, to punish and chastise such
  religious men, being within the bounds of their jurisdiction, as shall be
  convict before them, by lawful proof, of adultery, fornication, incest,
  or other fleshly incontinency, by committing them to ward and prison,
  there to remain for such time as shall be thought convenient for the
  quality of their trespasses."<a name="NtA_88"></a><a
  href="#Nt_88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

  <p>Previous to the passing of this act, therefore, the bishops, who had
  power to arrest laymen on suspicion of heresy, and detain them in prison
  untried,<a name="NtA_89"></a><a href="#Nt_89"><sup>89</sup></a> had no
  power to imprison priests, even though convicted of adultery or incest.
  The legislature were <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> supported by the Archbishop of
  Canterbury. Cardinal Morton procured authority from the pope to visit the
  religious houses, the abominations of which had become notorious;<a
  name="NtA_90"></a><a href="#Nt_90"><sup>90</sup></a> and in a provincial
  synod held on the 24th of February, 1486, he laid the condition of the
  secular clergy before the assembled prelates. Many priests, it was
  stated, spent their time in hawking or hunting, in lounging at taverns,
  in the dissolute enjoyment of the world. They wore their hair long like
  laymen; they were to be seen lounging in the streets with cloak and
  doublet, sword and dagger. By the scandal of their lives they imperilled
  the stability of their order.<a name="NtA_91"></a><a
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>91</sup></a> A number of the worst offenders, in
  London especially, were summoned before the synod and admonished;<a
  name="NtA_92"></a><a href="#Nt_92"><sup>92</sup></a> certain of the more
  zealous among the learned (<i>complures docti</i>) who had preached
  against clerical abuses were advised to be more cautious, for the
  avoiding of scandal;<a name="NtA_93"></a><a
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>93</sup></a> but the archbishop, taking the duty upon
  himself, sent round a circular among the clergy of his province,
  exhorting them to general amendment.<a name="NtA_94"></a><a
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>

  <p>Yet this little cloud again disappeared. Henry VII. sat too insecurely
  on his throne to venture on a resolute reform, even if his feelings had
  inclined him towards it, which they did not. Morton durst not resolutely
  grapple with the evil. He rebuked and remonstrated; but punishment would
  have caused a public scandal. He would not invite the inspection of the
  laity into a disease which, without their assistance, he had not the
  strength to encounter; and his incipient reformation died away
  ineffectually in words. The church, to outward appearance, stood more
  securely than ever. The obnoxious statutes of the Plantagenets were in
  abeyance, their very existence, as it seemed, was forgotten; and Thomas à
  Becket never desired more absolute independence for the ecclesiastical
  order than Archbishop Warham found established when he succeeded to the
  primacy. He, too, ventured to repeat the experiment of his predecessor.
  In 1511 he attempted a second visitation of the monasteries, and again
  exhorted a reform; but his efforts were even slighter than Morton's, and
  in their results equally without fruit. The maintenance of his order in
  its political supremacy was of greater moment to him than its moral
  purity: a decent veil was cast over the clerical infirmities, and their
  vices were forgotten as soon as they ceased to be proclaimed.<a
  name="NtA_95"></a><a href="#Nt_95"><sup>95</sup></a> Henry VIII., a mere
  boy on his accession, was borne away with the prevailing stream; and
  trained from his childhood by theologians, he entered upon his reign
  saturated with theological prepossessions. The intensity of his nature
  recognising no half measures, he was prepared to make them the law of his
  life; and so zealous was he, that it seemed as if the church had found in
  him a new Alfred or a Charlemagne. Unfortunately for the church,
  institutions may be restored in theory; but theory, be it never so
  perfect, will not give them back their life; and Henry discovered, at
  length, that the church of the sixteenth century as little resembled the
  church of the eleventh, as Leo X. resembled Hildebrand, or Warham
  resembled St. Anselm.</p>

  <p>If, however, there were no longer saints among the clergy, there could
  still arise among them a remarkable man; and in Cardinal Wolsey the king
  found an adviser who was able to retain him longer than would otherwise
  have been possible in the course which he had entered upon; who, holding
  a middle place between an English statesman and a catholic of the old
  order, was essentially a transition minister; and who was qualified,
  above all men then living, by a combination of talent, <!-- Page 62
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span> honesty, and
  arrogance, to open questions which could not again be closed when they
  had escaped the grasp of their originator. Under Wolsey's influence Henry
  made war with Louis of France, in the pope's quarrel, entered the polemic
  lists with Luther, and persecuted the English protestants. But Wolsey
  could not blind himself to the true condition of the church. He was too
  wise to be deceived with outward prosperity; he knew well that there lay
  before it, in Europe and at home, the alternative of ruin or amendment;
  and therefore he familiarised Henry with the sense that a reformation was
  inevitable, and dreaming that it could be effected from within, by the
  church itself inspired with a wiser spirit, he himself fell first victim
  of a convulsion which he had assisted to create, and which he attempted
  too late to stay.</p>

  <p>His intended measures were approaching maturity, when all Europe was
  startled by the news that Rome had been stormed by the Imperial army,
  that the pope was imprisoned, the churches pillaged, the cardinals
  insulted, and all holiest things polluted and profaned. A spectator,
  judging only by outward symptoms, would have seen at that strange crisis
  in Charles V. the worst patron of heresy, and the most dangerous enemy of
  the Holy See; while the indignation with which the news of these outrages
  was received at the English court, would have taught him to look on Henry
  as the one sovereign in Europe on whom that See might calculate most
  surely for support in its hour of danger. If he could have pierced below
  the surface, he would have found that the pope's best friend was the
  prince who held him prisoner; that Henry was but doubtfully acquiescing
  in the policy of an unpopular minister; and that the English nation would
  have looked on with stoical resignation if pope and papacy had been
  wrecked together. They were not inclined to heresy; but the
  ecclesiastical system was not the catholic faith; and this system, ruined
  by prosperity, was fast pressing its excesses to the extreme limit,
  beyond which it could not be endured. Wolsey talked of reformation, but
  delayed its coming; and in the mean time, the persons to be reformed
  showed no fear that it would come at all. The monasteries grew worse and
  worse. The people were taught only what they could teach themselves. The
  consistory courts became more oppressive. Pluralities multiplied, and
  non-residence and profligacy. Favoured parish clergy held as many as
  eight benefices.<a name="NtA_96"></a><a href="#Nt_96"><sup>96</sup></a>
  Bishops accumulated sees, and, unable to <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> attend to all,
  attended to none. Wolsey himself, the church reformer (so little did he
  really know what a reformation meant), was at once Archbishop of York,
  Bishop of Winchester, of Bath, and of Durham, and Abbot of St. Alban's.
  In Latimer's opinion, even twenty years later, and after no little reform
  in such matters, there was but one bishop in all England who was ever at
  his work and ever in his diocese. "I would ask a strange question," he
  said, in an audacious sermon at Paul's Cross, "Who is the most diligent
  bishop and prelate in all England, that passeth all the rest in doing of
  his office?<a name="NtA_97"></a><a href="#Nt_97"><sup>97</sup></a> I can
  tell, for I know him who it is; I know him well. But now I think I see
  you listening and hearkening that I should name him. There is one that
  passeth all the others, and is the most diligent prelate and preacher in
  all England. And will ye know who it is? I will tell you. It is the
  devil. Among all the pack of them that have cure, the devil shall go for
  my money, for he applieth his business. Therefore, ye unpreaching
  prelates, learn of the devil to be diligent in your office. If ye will
  not learn of God, for shame learn of the devil."<a name="NtA_98"></a><a
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

  <p>Under such circumstances, we need not be surprised to find the clergy
  sunk low in the respect of the English people. Sternly intolerant of each
  other's faults, the laity were not likely to be <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> indulgent to the
  vices of men who ought to have set an example of purity; and from time to
  time, during the first quarter of the century, there were explosions of
  temper which might have served as a warning if any sense or judgment had
  been left to profit by it.</p>

  <p>In 1514 a London merchant was committed to the Lollards' Tower for
  refusing to submit to an unjust exaction of mortuary;<a
  name="NtA_99"></a><a href="#Nt_99"><sup>99</sup></a> and a few days after
  was found dead in his cell. An inquest was held upon the body, when a
  verdict of wilful murder was returned against the chancellor of the
  Bishop of London; and so intense was the feeling of the city, that the
  bishop applied to Wolsey for a special jury to be chosen on the trial.
  "For assured I am," he said, "that if my chancellor be tried by any
  twelve men in London, they be so maliciously set <i>in favorem hæreticæ
  pravitatis</i>, that they will cast and condemn any clerk, though he were
  as innocent as Abel."<a name="NtA_100"></a><a
  href="#Nt_100"><sup>100</sup></a> Fish's famous pamphlet also shows the
  spirit which was seething; and though we may make some allowance for
  angry rhetoric, his words have the clear ring of honesty in them; and he
  spoke of what he had seen and knew. The monks, he tells the king, "be
  they that have made a hundred thousand idle dissolute women in your
  realm, who would have gotten their living honestly in the sweat of their
  faces had not their superfluous riches allured them to lust and idleness.
  These be they that when they have drawn men's wives to such incontinency,
  spend away their husbands' goods, make the women to run away from their
  husbands, bringing both man, wife, and children to idleness, theft, and
  beggary. Yea, who is able to number the great broad bottomless ocean sea
  full of evils that this mischievous generation may bring upon us if
  unpunished?"<a name="NtA_101"></a><a
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

  <p>Copies of this book were strewed about the London streets; Wolsey
  issued a prohibition against it, with the effect which such prohibitions
  usually have. Means were found to bring it under the eyes of Henry
  himself; and the manner in which it was received by him is full of
  significance, and betrays that the facts of the age were already telling
  on his understanding. He was always easy of access and easy of manner;
  and the story, <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> although it rests on Foxe's authority,
  has internal marks of authenticity.</p>

  <p>"One Master Edmund Moddis, being with the king in talk of religion,
  and of the new books that were come from beyond the seas, said that if it
  might please his Highness to pardon him, and such as he would bring to
  his Grace, he should see such a book as it was a marvel to hear of. The
  king demanded who they were? He said 'Two of your merchants&mdash;George
  Elliot and George Robinson.' The king appointed a time to speak with
  them. When they came before his presence in a privy closet, he demanded
  what they had to say or to shew him. One of them said that there was a
  book come to their hands which they had there to shew his Grace. When he
  saw it he demanded if any of them could read it. 'Yea,' said George
  Elliot, 'if it please your Grace to hear it.' 'I thought so,' said the
  king; 'if need were, thou couldst say it without book.'</p>

  <p>"The whole book being read out, the king made a long pause, and then
  said, 'If a man should pull down an old stone wall, and should begin at
  the lower part, the upper part thereof might chance to fall upon his
  head.' Then he took the book, and put it in his desk, and commanded them,
  on their allegiance, that they should not tell any man that he had seen
  it."<a name="NtA_102"></a><a href="#Nt_102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

  <p>Symptoms such as these boded ill for a self-reform of the church, and
  it was further imperilled by the difficulty which it is not easy to
  believe that Wolsey had forgotten. No measures would be of efficacy which
  spared the religious houses, and they would be equally useless unless the
  bishops, as well as the inferior clergy, were comprehended in the scheme
  of amendment. But neither with monks nor bishops could Wolsey interfere
  except by a commission from the pope, and the laws were unrepealed which
  forbade English subjects, under the severest penalties, to accept or
  exercise within the realm an authority which they had received from the
  Holy See. Morton had gone beyond the limits of the statute of provisors
  in receiving powers from Pope Innocent to visit the monasteries. But
  Morton had stopped short with inquiry and admonition. Wolsey, who was in
  earnest with the work, had desired and obtained a full commission as
  legate, but he could only make use of it at his peril. The statute
  slumbered, but it still existed.<a name="NtA_103"></a><a
  href="#Nt_103"><sup>103</sup></a> <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> He was exposing not
  himself only, but all persons, lay and clerical, who might recognise his
  legacy to a Premunire; and he knew well that Henry's connivance, or even
  expressed permission, could not avail him if his conduct was challenged.
  He could not venture to appeal to parliament. Parliament was the last
  authority whose jurisdiction a churchman would acknowledge in the
  concerns of the clergy; and his project must sooner or later have sunk,
  like those of his two predecessors, under its own internal difficulties,
  even if the accident had not arisen which brought the dispute to a
  special issue in its most vital point, and which, fostered by Wolsey for
  his own purposes, precipitated his ruin.</p>

  <p>It is never more difficult to judge equitably the actions of public
  men than when private as well as general motives have been allowed to
  influence them, or when their actions may admit of being represented as
  resulting from personal inclination, as well as from national policy. In
  life, as we actually experience it, motives slide one into the other, and
  the most careful analysis will fail adequately to sift them. In history,
  from the effort to make our conceptions distinct, we pronounce upon these
  intricate matters with unhesitating certainty, and we lose sight of truth
  in the desire to make it truer than itself. The difficulty is further
  complicated by the different points of view which are chosen by
  contemporaries and by posterity. Where motives are mixed, men all
  naturally dwell most on those which approach nearest to themselves:
  contemporaries whose interests are at stake overlook what is personal in
  consideration of what is to them of broader moment; posterity, unable to
  realise political embarrassments which have ceased to concern them,
  concentrate their attention on such features of the story as touch their
  own sympathies, and attend exclusively to the private and personal
  passions of the men and women whose character they are considering.</p>

  <p>These natural, and to some extent inevitable tendencies, explain the
  difference with which the divorce between Henry VIII. and Catherine of
  Arragon has been regarded by the English nation in the sixteenth and in
  the nineteenth centuries. In the former, not only did the parliament
  profess to desire it, urge it, and further it, but we are told by a
  contemporary<a name="NtA_104"></a><a href="#Nt_104"><sup>104</sup></a>
  that "all indifferent and discreet persons" judged that it was right <!--
  Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> and
  necessary. In the latter, perhaps, there is not one of ourselves who has
  not been taught to look upon it as an act of enormous wickedness. In the
  sixteenth century, Queen Catherine was an obstacle to the establishment
  of the kingdom, an incentive to treasonable hopes. In the nineteenth, she
  is an outraged and injured wife, the victim of a false husband's fickle
  appetite. The story is a long and painful one, and on its personal side
  need not concern us here further than as it illustrates the private
  character of Henry. Into the public bearing of it I must enter at some
  length, in order to explain the interest with which the nation threw
  itself into the question, and to remove the scandal with which, had
  nothing been at stake beyond the inclinations of a profligate monarch,
  weary of his queen, the complaisance on such a subject of the lords and
  commons of England would have coloured the entire complexion of the
  Reformation.</p>

  <p>The succession to the throne, although determined in theory by the
  ordinary law of primogeniture, was nevertheless, subject to repeated
  arbitrary changes. The uncertainty of the rule was acknowledged and
  deplored by the parliament,<a name="NtA_105"></a><a
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>105</sup></a> and there was no order of which the
  nation, with any unity of sentiment, compelled the observance. An opinion
  prevailed&mdash;not, I believe, traceable to statute, but admitted by
  custom, and having the force of statute in the prejudices of the
  nation&mdash;that no stranger born out of the realm could inherit.<a
  name="NtA_106"></a><a href="#Nt_106"><sup>106</sup></a> Although the
  descent in the female line was not formally denied, no female sovereign
  had ever, in fact, sat upon the throne.<a name="NtA_107"></a><a
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>107</sup></a> Even Henry VII. refused to strengthen
  his title by advancing the claims of his wife: and the uncertainty of the
  laws of marriage, and the innumerable refinements of the Romish canon
  law, which affected the legitimacy of children,<a name="NtA_108"></a><a
  href="#Nt_108"><sup>108</sup></a> furnished, in connection <!-- Page 68
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> with the
  further ambiguities of clerical dispensations, perpetual pretexts,
  whenever pretexts were needed, for a breach of allegiance. So long,
  indeed, as the character of the nation remained essentially military, it
  could as little tolerate an incapable king as an army in a dangerous
  campaign can bear with an inefficient commander; and whatever might be
  the theory of the title, when the sceptre was held by the infirm hand of
  an Edward II., a Richard II., or a Henry VI., the difficulty resolved
  itself by force, and it was wrenched by a stronger arm from a grasp too
  feeble to retain it. The consent of the nation was avowed, even in the
  authoritative language of a statute,<a name="NtA_109"></a><a
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>109</sup></a> as essential to the legitimacy of a
  sovereign's title; and Sir Thomas More, on examination by the
  Solicitor-General, declared as his opinion that parliament had power to
  depose kings if it so pleased.<a name="NtA_110"></a><a
  href="#Nt_110"><sup>110</sup></a> So many uncertainties on a point so
  vital had occasioned fearful episodes in English history; the most
  fearful of them, which had traced its character in blood in the private
  records of every English family, having been the long struggle of the
  preceding century, from which the nation was still suffering, and had but
  recovered sufficiently to be conscious of what it had endured. It had
  decimated itself for a question which involved no principle and led to no
  result, and perhaps the history of the world may be searched in vain for
  any parallel to a quarrel at once so desperate and so unmeaning.</p>

  <p>This very unmeaning character of the dispute increased the difficulty
  of ending it. In wars of conquest or of principle, when something
  definite is at stake, the victory is either won, or it is lost; the
  conduct of individual men, at all events, is overruled by considerations
  external to themselves which admit of being weighed and calculated. In a
  war of succession, where the great families were divided in their
  allegiance, and supported the rival claimants in evenly balanced numbers,
  the inveteracy of the conflict increased with its duration, and
  propagated itself from generation to generation. Every family <!-- Page
  69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> was in
  blood feud with its neighbour; and children, as they grew to manhood,
  inherited the duty of revenging their fathers' deaths.</p>

  <p>No effort of imagination can reproduce to us the state of this country
  in the fatal years which intervened between the first rising of the Duke
  of York and the battle of Bosworth; and experience too truly convinced
  Henry VII. that the war had ceased only from general exhaustion, and not
  because there was no will to continue it. The first Tudor breathed an
  atmosphere of suspended insurrection, and only when we remember the
  probable effect upon his mind of the constant dread of an explosion, can
  we excuse or understand, in a prince not generally cruel, the execution
  of the Earl of Warwick. The danger of a bloody revolution may present an
  act of arbitrary or cowardly tyranny in the light of a public duty.</p>

  <p>Fifty years of settled government, however, had not been without their
  effects. The country had collected itself; the feuds of the families had
  been chastened, if they had not been subdued; while the increase of
  wealth and material prosperity had brought out into obvious prominence
  those advantages of peace which a hot-spirited people, antecedent to
  experience, had not anticipated, and had not been able to appreciate.
  They were better fed, better cared for, more justly governed than they
  had ever been before; and though abundance of unruly tempers remained,
  yet the wiser portion of the nation, looking back from their new
  vantage-ground, were able to recognise the past in its true hatefulness.
  Thenceforward a war of succession was the predominating terror with
  English statesmen, and the safe establishment of the reigning family bore
  a degree of importance which it is possible that their fears exaggerated,
  yet which in fact was the determining principle of their action.</p>

  <p>It was therefore with no little anxiety that the council of Henry
  VIII. perceived his male children, on whom their hopes were centred,
  either born dead, or dying one after another within a few days of their
  birth, as if his family were under a blight. When the queen had advanced
  to an age which precluded hope of further offspring, and the heir
  presumptive was an infirm girl, the unpromising prospect became yet more
  alarming. The life of the Princess Mary was precarious, for her health
  was weak from her childhood. If she lived, her accession would be a
  temptation to insurrection; if she did not live, and the king had no
  other children, a civil war was inevitable. At present such a difficulty
  would be disposed of by an immediate <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> and simple reference
  to the collateral branches of the royal family; the crown would descend
  with even more facility than the property of an intestate to the next of
  kin. At that time, if the rule had been recognised, it would only have
  increased the difficulty, for the next heir in blood was James of
  Scotland; and, gravely as statesmen desired the union of the two
  countries, in the existing mood of the people, the very stones in London
  streets, it was said,<a name="NtA_111"></a><a
  href="#Nt_111"><sup>111</sup></a> would rise up against a king of
  Scotland who claimed to enter England as sovereign. Even the parliament
  itself declared in formal language that they would resist any attempt on
  the part of the Scottish king "to the uttermost of their power."<a
  name="NtA_112"></a><a href="#Nt_112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

  <p>As little, however, as the English would have admitted James's claims,
  would James himself have acknowledged their right to reject them. He
  would have pleaded the sacred right of inheritance, refusing utterly the
  imaginary law which disentitled him: he would have pressed his title with
  all Scotland to back him, and probably with the open support of France.
  Centuries of humiliation remained unrevenged, which both France and
  Scotland had endured at English hands. It was not likely that they would
  waste an opportunity thrust upon them by Providence. The country might,
  it is true, have encountered this danger, serious as it would have been,
  if there had been hope that it would itself have agreed to any other
  choice. England had many times fought successfully against the same odds,
  and would have cared little for a renewal of the struggle, if united in
  itself: but the prospect on this side, also, was fatally discouraging.
  The elements of the old factions were dormant, but still smouldering.
  Throughout Henry's reign a White Rose agitation had been secretly
  fermenting; without open success, and without chance of success so long
  as Henry lived, but formidable in a high degree if opportunity to strike
  should offer itself. Richard de la Pole, the representative of this
  party, had been killed at Pavia, but his loss had rather strengthened
  their cause than weakened it, for by his long exile he was unknown in
  England; his personal character was without energy; while he made place
  for the leadership of a far more powerful spirit in the sister of the
  murdered Earl of Warwick, the Countess of Salisbury, mother of Reginald
  Pole. This lady had inherited, in no common degree, the fierce nature of
  the Plantagenets; born to command, she had rallied round her the
  Courtenays, the Nevilles, and all the powerful kindred of Richard the
  King <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>[pg
  71]</span> Maker, her grandfather. Her Plantagenet descent was purer than
  the king's; and if Mary died and Henry left no other issue, half England
  was likely to declare either for one of her sons, or for the Marquis of
  Exeter, the grandson of Edward IV.</p>

  <p>In 1515, when Giustiniani,<a name="NtA_113"></a><a
  href="#Nt_113"><sup>113</sup></a> the Venetian ambassador, was at the
  court, the Dukes of Buckingham, of Suffolk, and of Norfolk, were also
  mentioned to him as having each of them hopes of the crown. Buckingham,
  meddling prematurely in the dangerous game, had lost his life for it; but
  in his death he had strengthened the chance of Norfolk, who had married
  his daughter. Suffolk was Henry's brother-in-law;<a name="NtA_114"></a><a
  href="#Nt_114"><sup>114</sup></a> chivalrous, popular, and the ablest
  soldier of his day; and Lady Margaret Lennox, also, daughter of the Queen
  of Scotland by her second marriage, would not have wanted supporters, and
  early became an object of intrigue. Indeed, as she had been born in
  England, it was held in parliament that she stood next in order to the
  Princess Mary.<a name="NtA_115"></a><a
  href="#Nt_115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

  <p>Many of these claims were likely to be advanced if Henry died leaving
  a daughter to succeed him. They would all inevitably be advanced if he
  died childless; and no great political sagacity was required to foresee
  the probable fate of the country if such a moment was chosen for a French
  and Scottish invasion. The very worst disasters might be too surely
  looked for, and the hope of escape, precarious at the best, hung upon the
  frail thread of a single life. We may therefore imagine the dismay with
  which the nation saw this last hope failing them&mdash;and failing them
  even in a manner more dangerous than if it had failed by death; for it
  did but add another doubt, when already there were too many. In order to
  detach France from Scotland, and secure, if possible, its support for the
  claims of the princess, it had been proposed to marry the Princess Mary
  to a son of the French king. The negotiations were conducted through the
  Bishop of Tarbês,<a name="NtA_116"></a><a
  href="#Nt_116"><sup>116</sup></a> and at the first conference the Bishop
  raised a question in the name of his government, on the validity of the
  papal dispensation granted by Julius the Second, to legalise the marriage
  from which she was sprung. The abortive marriage Scheme perished <!--
  Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> in
  its birth, but the doubt which had been raised could not perish with it.
  Doubt on such a subject once mooted might not be left unresolved, even if
  the raising it thus publicly had not itself destroyed the frail chance of
  an undisputed succession. If the relations of Henry with Queen Catherine
  had been of a cordial kind, it is possible that he would have been
  contented with resentment; that he would have refused to reconsider a
  question which touched his honour and his conscience; and, united with
  parliament, would have endeavoured to bear down all difficulties with a
  high hand. This at least he might have himself attempted. Whether the
  parliament, with so precarious a future before them, would have
  consented, is less easy to say. Fortunately or unfortunately, the
  interests of the nation pointed out another road, which Henry had no
  unwillingness to enter.</p>

  <p>On the death of Prince Arthur, five months after his marriage, Henry
  VII. and the father of the Princess alike desired that the bond between
  their families thus broken should be re-united; and, as soon as it became
  clear that Catherine had not been left pregnant (a point which, tacitly
  at least, she allowed to be considered uncertain at the time of her
  husband's decease), it was proposed that she should be transferred, with
  the inheritance of the crown, to the new heir. A dispensation was
  reluctantly granted by the pope,<a name="NtA_117"></a><a
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>117</sup></a> and reluctantly accepted by the English
  ministry. The Prince of Wales, who was no more than twelve years old at
  the time, was under the age at which he could legally sue for such an
  object; and a portion of the English council, the Archbishop of
  Canterbury among them, were unsatisfied,<a name="NtA_118"></a><a
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>118</sup></a> both with the marriage itself, and with
  the adequacy of the forms observed in a matter of so dubious an import.
  The betrothal took place at the urgency of Ferdinand. In the year
  following Henry VII. became suddenly ill; Queen Elizabeth died; and
  superstition working on the previous hesitation, misfortune was construed
  into an indication of the displeasure of Heaven. The intention was
  renounced, and the prince, as soon as he had completed his fourteenth
  year, was invited and required to disown, by a formal act, the
  obligations contracted in <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> his name.<a name="NtA_119"></a><a
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>119</sup></a> Again there was a change. The king
  lived on, the alarm yielded to the temptations of covetousness. Had he
  restored Catherine to her father he must have restored with her the
  portion of her dowry which had been already received; he must have
  relinquished the prospect of the moiety which had yet to be received. The
  negotiation was renewed. Henry VII. lived to sign the receipts for the
  first instalment of the second payment;<a name="NtA_120"></a><a
  href="#Nt_120"><sup>120</sup></a> and on his death, notwithstanding much
  general murmuring,<a name="NtA_121"></a><a
  href="#Nt_121"><sup>121</sup></a> the young Henry, then a boy of
  eighteen, proceeded to carry out his father's ultimate intentions. The
  princess-dowager, notwithstanding what had passed, was still on her side
  willing;&mdash;and the difference of age (she was six years older than
  Henry) seeming of little moment when both were comparatively young, they
  were married. For many years all went well; opposition was silenced by
  the success which seemed to have followed, and the original scruples were
  forgotten. Though the marriage was dictated by political convenience,
  Henry was faithful, with but one exception, to his wife's bed&mdash;no
  slight honour to him, if he is measured by the average royal standard in
  such matters; and, if his sons had lived to grow up around his throne,
  there is no reason to believe that the peace of his married life would
  have been interrupted, or that, whatever might have been his private
  feelings, he would have appeared in the world's eye other than
  acquiescent in his condition.</p>

<!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>

  <p>But his sons had not lived; years passed on, bringing with them
  premature births, children born dead, or dying after a few days or
  hours,<a name="NtA_122"></a><a href="#Nt_122"><sup>122</sup></a> and the
  disappointment was intense in proportion to the interests which were at
  issue. The especial penalty denounced against the marriage with a
  brother's wife<a name="NtA_123"></a><a href="#Nt_123"><sup>123</sup></a>
  had been all but literally enforced; and the king found himself growing
  to middle life and his queen passing beyond it with his prayers unheard,
  and no hope any longer that they might be heard. The disparity of age
  also was more perceptible as time went by, while Catherine's constitution
  was affected by her misfortunes, and differences arose on which there is
  no occasion to dwell in these pages&mdash;differences which in themselves
  reflected no discredit either on the husband or the wife, but which were
  sufficient to extinguish between two infirm human beings an affection
  that had rested only upon mutual esteem, but had not assumed the
  character of love.</p>

  <p>The circumstances in which Catherine was placed were of a kind which
  no sensitive woman could have endured without impatience and
  mortification; but her conduct, however natural, only widened the breach
  which personal repugnance and radical opposition of character had already
  made too wide. So far Henry and she were alike that both had imperious
  tempers, and both were indomitably obstinate; but Henry was hot and <!--
  Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>
  impetuous, Catherine was cold and self-contained&mdash;Henry saw his duty
  through his wishes; Catherine, in her strong Castilian austerity,
  measured her steps by the letter of the law; the more her husband
  withdrew from her, the more she insisted upon her relation to him as his
  wife; and continued with fixed purpose and immovable countenance<a
  name="NtA_124"></a><a href="#Nt_124"><sup>124</sup></a> to share his
  table and his bed long after she was aware of his dislike for her.</p>

  <p>If the validity of so unfortunate a connection had never been
  questioned, or if no national interests had been dependent on the
  continuance or the abolition of it, these discomforts were not too great
  to have been endured in silence. They were not originally occasioned by
  any latent inclination on the part of the king for another woman. They
  had arisen to their worst dimensions before he had ever seen Anne Boleyn,
  and were produced by causes of a wholly independent kind; and even if it
  had not been so, when we remember the tenor of his early life we need not
  think that he would have been unequal to the restraint which ordinary
  persons in similar circumstances are able to impose on their caprices.
  The legates spoke no more than the truth when they wrote to the pope,
  saying that "it was mere madness to suppose that the king would act as he
  was doing merely out of dislike of the queen, or out of inclination, for
  another person; he was not a man whom harsh manners and an unpleasant
  disposition (<i>duri mores et injucunda consuetudo</i>) could so far
  provoke; nor could any sane man believe him to be so infirm of character
  that sensual allurements would have led him to dissolve a connexion in
  which he had passed the flower of youth without stain or blemish, and in
  which he had borne himself in his trial so reverently and honourably."<a
  name="NtA_125"></a><a href="#Nt_125"><sup>125</sup></a> I consider this
  entirely true in a sense which no great knowledge of human nature is
  required to understand. The king's personal dissatisfaction was great: if
  this had been all, however, it would have been extinguished or endured;
  but the interests of the nation, imperilled as they were by the
  maintenance of the marriage, entitled him to regard his position under
  another aspect. Even if the marriage in itself had never been questioned,
  he might justly have desired the dissolution of it; and when he recalled
  the circumstances under which it was contracted, the hesitation of the
  council, the reluctance of the pope, the alarms and vacillation of his
  father, we may readily perceive how scruples of conscience must have
  arisen in a soil well prepared to receive <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> them&mdash;how the
  loss of his children must have appeared as a judicial sentence on a
  violation of the Divine law. The divorce presented itself to him as a
  moral obligation, when national advantage combined with superstition to
  encourage what he secretly desired; and if he persuaded himself that
  those public reasons, without which, in truth and fact, he would not have
  stirred, were those that alone were influencing him, the self-deceit was
  of a kind with which the experience of most men will probably have made
  them too familiar. In those rare cases where inclination coincides with
  right, we cannot be surprised if mankind should mislead themselves with
  the belief that the disinterested motives weigh more with them than the
  personal.</p>

  <p>A remarkable and very candid account of Henry's feelings is furnished
  by himself in one of the many papers of instructions<a
  name="NtA_126"></a><a href="#Nt_126"><sup>126</sup></a> which he
  forwarded to his secretary at Rome. Hypocrisy was not among his faults,
  and in detailing the arguments which were to be laid before the pope he
  has exhibited a more complete revelation of what was passing in
  himself&mdash;and indirectly of his own nature in its strength and
  weakness&mdash;than he perhaps imagined while he wrote. The despatch is
  long and perplexed; the style that of a man who saw his end clearly, and
  was vexed with the intricate and dishonest trifling with which his way
  was impeded, and which nevertheless he was struggling to tolerate. The
  secretary was to say, "that the King's Highness having above all other
  things his intent and mind ever founded upon such respect unto Almighty
  God as to a Christian and catholic prince doth appertain, knowing the
  fragility and uncertainty of all earthly things, and how displeasant unto
  God, how much dangerous to the soul, how dishonourable and damageable to
  the world it were to prefer vain and transitory things unto those that be
  perfect and certain, hath in this cause, doubt, and matter of matrimony,
  whereupon depend so high and manifold consequences of greatest
  importance, always cast from his conceit the darkness and blundering
  confusion of falsity, and specially hath had and put before his eyes the
  light and shining brightness of truth; upon which foundation as a most
  sure base for perpetual tranquillity of his conscience his Highness hath
  expressly resolved and determined with himself to build and establish all
  his acts, deeds, and cogitations touching this matter; without God did
  build the house, in vain they laboured that went about to build it; and
  all actions grounded upon that immovable fundament of truth, must needs
  therein be firm, <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> sound, whole, perfect, and worthy of a
  Christian man; which if truth were put apart, they could not for the same
  reason be but evil, vain, slipper, uncertain, and in nowise permanent or
  endurable." He then laboured to urge on the pope the duty of
  straightforward dealing; and dwelt in words which have a sad interest for
  us (when we consider the manner in which the subject of them has been
  dealt with) on the judgment bar, not of God only, but of human posterity,
  at which his conduct would be ultimately tried.</p>

  <p>"The causes of private persons dark and doubtful be sometimes," the
  king said, "pretermitted and passed over as things more meet at some
  seasons to be dissimuled than by continual strife and plea to nourish
  controversies. Yet since all people have their eyes conject upon princes,
  whose acts and doings not only be observed in the mouths of them that now
  do live, but also remain in such perpetual memory to our posterity [so
  that] the evil, if any there be, cannot but appear and come to light,
  there is no reason for toleration, no place for dissimulation; but [there
  is reason] more deeply, highly, and profoundly to penetrate and search
  for the truth, so that the same may vanquish and overcome, and all guilt,
  craft, and falsehood clearly be extirpate and reject."</p>

  <p>I am anticipating the progress of the story in making these
  quotations; for the main burden of the despatch concerns a forged
  document which had been introduced by the Roman lawyers to embarrass the
  process, and of which I shall by-and-bye have to speak directly; but I
  have desired to illustrate the spirit in which Henry entered upon the
  general question&mdash;assuredly a more calm and rational one than
  historians have usually represented it to be. In dealing with the
  obstacle which had been raised, he displayed a most efficient mastery
  over himself, although he did not conclude without touching the pith of
  the matter with telling clearness. The secretary was to take some
  opportunity of speaking to the pope privately; and of warning him, "as of
  himself," that there was no hope that the king would give way: he was to
  "say plainly to his Holiness that the king's desire and intent
  <i>convolare ad secundas nuptias non patitur negativum</i>; and
  whatsoever should be found of bull, brief, or otherwise, his Highness
  found his conscience so inquieted, his succession in such danger, and his
  most royal person in such perplexity for things unknown and not to be
  spoken, that other remedy there was not but his Grace to come by one way
  or other, and specially at his hands, if it might be, to the desired <!--
  Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> end;
  and that all concertation to the contrary should be vain and
  frustrate."</p>

  <p>So peremptory a conviction and so determined a purpose were of no
  sudden growth, and had been probably maturing in his mind for years, when
  the gangrene was torn open by the Bishop of Tarbês, and accident
  precipitated his resolution. The momentous consequences involved, and the
  reluctance to encounter a probable quarrel with the emperor, might have
  long kept him silent, except for some extraneous casualty; but the tree
  being thus rudely shaken, the ripe fruit fell. The capture of Rome
  occurring almost at the same moment, Wolsey caught the opportunity to
  break the Spanish alliance; and the prospect of a divorce was grasped at
  by him as a lever by which to throw the weight of English power and
  influence into the papal scale, to commit Henry definitely to the
  catholic cause. Like his acceptance of legatine authority, the expedient
  was a desperate one, and if it failed it was ruinous. The nation at that
  time was sincerely attached to Spain. The alliance with the house of
  Burgundy was of old date; the commercial intercourse with Flanders was
  enormous, Flanders, in fact, absorbing all the English exports; and as
  many as 15,000 Flemings were settled in London. Charles himself was
  personally popular; he had been the ally of England in the late French
  war; and when in his supposed character of leader of the anti-papal party
  in Europe he allowed a Lutheran army to desecrate Rome, he had won the
  sympathy of all the latent discontent which was fermenting in the
  population. France, on the other hand, was as cordially hated as Spain
  was beloved. A state of war with France was the normal condition of
  England; and the reconquest of it the universal dream from the cottage to
  the castle. Henry himself, early in his reign, had shared in this
  delusive ambition; and but three years before the sack of Rome, when the
  Duke of Suffolk led an army into Normandy, Wolsey's purposed tardiness in
  sending reinforcements had alone saved Paris.<a name="NtA_127"></a><a
  href="#Nt_127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

  <p>There could be no doubt, therefore, that a breach with the emperor
  would in a high degree be unwelcome to the country. The king, and
  probably such members of the council as were aware of his feelings,
  shrank from offering an open affront to the Spanish people., and anxious
  as they were for a settlement of the succession, perhaps trusted that
  advantage might be taken of some political contingency for a private
  arrangement; that <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> Catherine might be induced by Charles
  himself to retire privately, and sacrifice herself, of her free will, to
  the interests of the two countries. This, however, is no more than
  conjecture; I think it probable, because so many English statesmen were
  in favour at once of the divorce and of the Spanish alliance&mdash;two
  objects which, only on some such hypothesis, were compatible. The fact
  cannot be ascertained, however, because the divorce itself was not
  discussed at the council table until Wolsey had induced the king to
  change his policy by the hope of immediate relief.</p>

  <p>Wolsey has revealed to us fully his own objects in a letter to Sir
  Gregory Cassalis, his agent at Rome. He shared with half Europe in an
  impression that the emperor's Italian campaigns were designed to further
  the Reformation; and of this central delusion he formed the keystone of
  his conduct. "First condoling with his Holiness," he wrote, "on the
  unhappy position in which, with the college of the most reverend
  cardinals, he is placed,<a name="NtA_128"></a><a
  href="#Nt_128"><sup>128</sup></a> you shall tell him how, day and night,
  I am revolving by what means or contrivance I may bring comfort to the
  church of Christ, and raise the fallen state of our most Holy Lord. I
  care not whit it may cost me, whether of expense or trouble; nay, though
  I have to shed my blood, or give my life for it, assuredly so long as
  life remains to me for this I will labour. And how let me mention the
  great and marvellous effects which have been wrought by my
  instrumentality on the mind of my most excellent master the king, whom I
  have persuaded to unite himself with his Holiness in heart and soul. I
  urged innumerable reasons to induce him to part him from the emperor, to
  whom he clung with much tenacity. The most effective of them all was the
  constancy with which I assured him of the good-will and affection which
  were felt for him by his Holiness, and the certainty that his Holiness
  would furnish proof of his friendship in conceding his said Majesty's
  requests, in such form as the church's treasure and the authority of the
  Vicar of Christ shall permit, or so far as that authority extends or may
  extend. I have undertaken, moreover, for all these things in their utmost
  latitude, pledging my salvation, my faith, my honour and soul upon them.
  I have said that his demands shall be granted amply and fully, without
  scruple, without room or occasion being left for after-retractation; and
  the King's Majesty, in consequence, believing on these my solemn
  asseverations that the Pope's Holiness is really and indeed well inclined
  towards him, accepting what is spoken by me as spoken by the <!-- Page 80
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> legate of
  the Apostolic See, and therefore, as in the name of his Holiness, has
  determined to run the risk which I have pressed upon him; he will spare
  no labour or expense, he will disregard the wishes of his subjects, and
  the private interest of his Realm, to attach himself cordially and
  constantly to the Holy See."<a name="NtA_129"></a><a
  href="#Nt_129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

  <p>These were the words of a man who loved England well, but who loved
  Rome better; and Wolsey has received but scanty justice from catholic
  writers, since he sacrificed himself for the catholic cause. His scheme
  was bold and well laid, being weak only in that it was confessedly in
  contradiction to the instincts and genius of the nation, by which, and by
  which alone, in the long run, either this or any other country has been
  successfully governed. And yet he might well be forgiven if he ventured
  on an unpopular course in the belief that the event would justify him;
  and that, in uniting with France to support the pope, he was not only
  consulting the true interest of England, but was doing what England
  actually desired, although blindly aiming at her object by other means.
  The French wars, however traditionally popular, were fertile only in
  glory. The rivalry of the two countries was a splendid folly, wasting the
  best blood of both countries for an impracticable chimera; and though
  there was impatience of ecclesiastical misrule, though there was jealousy
  of foreign interference, and general irritation with the state of the
  church, yet the mass of the people hated protestantism even worse than
  they hated the pope, the clergy, and the consistory courts. They
  believed&mdash;and Wolsey was, perhaps, the only leading member of the
  privy council, except Archbishop Warham, who was not under the same
  delusion&mdash;that it was possible for a national church to separate
  itself from the unity of Christendom, and at the same time to crush or
  prevent innovation of doctrine; that faith in the sacramental system
  could still be maintained, though the priesthood by whom those mysteries
  were dispensed should minister in gilded chains. This was the English
  historical theory handed down from William Rufus, the second Henry, and
  the Edwards; yet it was and is a mere phantasm, a thing of words and
  paper fictions, as Wolsey saw it to be. Wolsey knew well that an
  ecclesiastical revolt implied, as a certainty, innovation of doctrine;
  that plain men could not and would not continue to reverence the office
  of the priesthood, when the priests were treated as the paid officials of
  an earthly authority higher than their own. <!-- Page 81 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span> He was not to be
  blamed if he took the people at their word; if he believed that, in their
  doctrinal conservatism, they knew and meant what they were saying: and
  the reaction which took place under Queen Mary, when the Anglican system
  had been tried and failed, and the alternative was seen to be absolute
  between a union with Rome or a forfeiture of catholic orthodoxy, prove
  after all that he was wiser than in the immediate event he seemed to be;
  that if his policy had succeeded, and if, strengthened by success, he had
  introduced into the church those reforms which he had promised and
  desired,<a name="NtA_130"></a><a href="#Nt_130"><sup>130</sup></a> he
  would have satisfied the substantial wishes of the majority of the
  nation.</p>

  <p>Like other men of genius, Wolsey also combined practical sagacity with
  an unmeasured power of hoping. As difficulties gathered round him, he
  encountered them with the increasing magnificence of his schemes; and
  after thirty years' experience of public life, he was as sanguine as a
  boy. Armed with this little lever of the divorce, he saw himself, in
  imagination, the rebuilder of the catholic faith and the deliverer of
  Europe. The king being remarried, and the succession settled, he would
  purge the Church of England, and convert the monasteries into
  intellectual garrisons of pious and learned men, occupying the land from
  end to end. The feuds with France should cease for ever, and, united in a
  holy cause, the two countries should restore the papacy, put down the
  German heresies, depose the emperor, and establish in his place some
  faithful servant of the church. Then Europe once more at peace, the
  hordes of the Crescent, which were threatening to settle the quarrels of
  Christians in the West as they had settled them in the East&mdash;by the
  extinction of Christianity itself,&mdash;were to be hurled back into
  their proper barbarism.<a name="NtA_131"></a><a
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>131</sup></a> These magnificent visions fell from him
  in conversations <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span> with the Bishop of Bayonne, and may be
  gathered from hints and fragments of his correspondence. Extravagant as
  they seem, the prospect of realising them was, humanly speaking, neither
  chimerical nor even improbable. He had but made the common mistake of men
  of the world who are the representatives of an old order of things at the
  time when that order is doomed and dying. He could not read the signs of
  the times; and confounded the barrenness of death with the barrenness of
  a winter which might be followed by a new spring and summer; he believed
  that the old life-tree of Catholicism, which in fact was but cumbering
  the ground, might bloom again in its old beauty. The thing which he
  called heresy was the fire of Almighty God, which no politic congregation
  of princes, no state machinery, though it were never so active, could
  trample out; and as in the early years of Christianity the meanest slave
  who was thrown to the wild beasts for his presence at the forbidden
  mysteries of the gospel, saw deeper, in the divine power of his faith,
  into the future even of this earthly world than the sagest of his
  imperial persecutors, so a truer political prophet than Wolsey would have
  been found in the most ignorant of those poor men, for whom his myrmidons
  were searching in the purlieus of London, who were risking death and
  torture in disseminating the pernicious volumes of the English
  Testament.</p>

  <p>If we look at the matter, however, from a more earthly point of view,
  the causes which immediately defeated Wolsey's policy were not such as
  human foresight could have anticipated. We ourselves, surveying the
  various parties in Europe with the light of our knowledge of the actual
  sequel, are perhaps able to understand their real relations; but if in
  1527 a political astrologer had foretold that within two years of that
  time the pope and the emperor who had imprisoned him would be cordial
  allies, that the positions of England and Spain toward the papacy would
  be diametrically reversed, and that the two countries were on the point
  of taking their posts, which they would ever afterwards maintain, as the
  champions respectively of the opposite principles to those which at that
  time they seemed to represent, the prophecy would have been held scarcely
  less insane than a prophecy six or even three years before the event,
  that in the year 1854 England would be united with an Emperor Napoleon
  for the preservation of European order.</p>

  <p>Henry, then, in the spring of the year 1527, definitively breaking the
  Spanish alliance, formed a league with Francis I., the avowed object of
  which was the expulsion of the Imperialists <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> from Italy; with a
  further intention&mdash;if it could be carried into effect&mdash;of
  avenging the outrage offered to Europe in the pope's imprisonment, by
  declaring vacant the imperial throne. Simultaneously with the congress at
  Amiens where the terms of the alliance were arranged, confidential
  persons were despatched into Italy to obtain an interview&mdash;if
  possible&mdash;with the pope, and formally laying before him the
  circumstances of the king's position, to request him to make use of his
  powers to provide a remedy. It is noticeable that at the outset of the
  negotiation the king did not fully trust Wolsey. The latter had
  suggested, as the simplest method of proceeding, that the pope should
  extend his authority as legate, granting him plenary power to act as
  English vicegerent so long as Rome was occupied by the Emperor's troops.
  Henry, not wholly satisfied that he was acquainted with his minister's
  full intentions in desiring so large a capacity, sent his own secretary,
  unknown to Wolsey, with his own private propositions&mdash;requesting
  simply a dispensation to take a second wife, his former marriage being
  allowed to stand with no definite sentence passed upon it; or, if that
  were impossible, leaving the pope to choose his own method, and settle
  the question in the manner least difficult and least offensive.<a
  name="NtA_132"></a><a href="#Nt_132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>

  <p>Wolsey, however, soon satisfied the king that he had no sinister
  intentions. By the middle of the winter we find the private messenger
  associated openly with Sir Gregory Cassalis, the agent of the minister's
  communications;<a name="NtA_133"></a><a href="#Nt_133"><sup>133</sup></a>
  and a series of formal demands were presented jointly by these two
  persons in the names of Henry and the legate; which, though taking many
  forms, resolved themselves substantially into one. The pope was required
  to make use of his dispensing power to enable the King of England to
  marry a wife who could bear him children, and thus provide some better
  security than already existed for the succession to the throne. This
  demand could not be considered as in itself unreasonable; and if personal
  feeling was combined with other motives to induce Henry to press it,
  personal feeling did not affect the general bearing of the question. The
  king's desire was publicly urged on public grounds, and thus, and thus
  only, the pope was at liberty to consider it. The marriages of princes
  have ever been affected by other considerations than those which
  influence such relations between private persons. Princes may not, as
  "unvalued <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>[pg
  84]</span> persons" may, "carve for themselves;" they pay the penalty of
  their high place, in submitting their affections to the welfare of the
  state; and the same causes which regulate the formation of these ties
  must be allowed to influence the continuance of them. The case which was
  submitted to the pope was one of those for which his very power of
  dispensing had been vested in him; and being, as he called himself, the
  Father of Christendom, the nation thought themselves entitled to call
  upon him to make use of that power. A resource of the kind must exist
  somewhere&mdash;the relation between princes and subjects indispensably
  requiring it. It had been vested in the Bishop of Rome, because it had
  been presumed that the sanctity of his office would secure an impartial
  exercise of his authority. And unless he could have shown (which he never
  attempted to show) that the circumstances of the succession were not so
  precarious as to call for his interference, it would seem that the
  express contingency had arisen which was contemplated in the constitution
  of the canon law;<a name="NtA_134"></a><a
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>134</sup></a> and that where a provision had been
  made by the church of which he was the earthly head, for difficulties of
  this precise description, the pope was under an obligation either to make
  the required concessions in virtue of his faculty, or, if he found
  himself unable to make those concessions, to offer some distinct
  explanation of his refusal. I speak of the question as nakedly political.
  I am not considering the private injuries of which Catherine had so deep
  a right to complain, nor the complications subsequently raised on the
  original validity of the first marriage. A political difficulty, on which
  alone he was bound to give sentence, was laid before the pope in his
  judicial capacity, in the name of the nation; and the painful features
  which the process afterwards assumed are due wholly to his original
  weakness and vacillation.</p>

  <p>Deeply, however, as we must all deplore the scandal and suffering
  which were occasioned by the dispute, it was in a high degree fortunate,
  that at the crisis of public dissatisfaction in England with the
  condition of the church, especially in the conduct of its courts of
  justice, a cause should have arisen which tested the whole question of
  church authority in its highest <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> form; where the dispute between the
  laity and the ecclesiastics was represented in a process in which the
  pope sat as judge; in which the king was the appellant, and the most
  vital interests of the nation were at stake upon the issue. It was no
  accident which connected a suit for divorce with the reformation of
  religion. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction was upon its trial, and the
  future relations of church and state depended upon the pope's conduct in
  a matter which no technical skill was required to decide, but only the
  moral virtues of probity and courage. The time had been when the clergy
  feared only to be unjust, and when the functions of judges might safely
  be entrusted to them. The small iniquities of the consistory courts had
  shaken the popular faith in the continued operation of such a fear; and
  the experience of an Alexander VI., a Julius II., and a Leo X. had
  induced a suspicion that even in the highest quarters justice had ceased
  to be much considered. It remained for Clement VII. to disabuse men of
  their alarms, or by confirming them to forfeit for ever the supremacy of
  his order in England. Nor can it be said for him that the case was one in
  which it was unusually difficult to be virtuous. Justice, wounded
  dignity, and the interests of the See pointed alike to the same course.
  Queen Catherine's relationship to the emperor could not have recommended
  her to the tenderness of the pope, and the policy of assenting to an act
  which would infallibly alienate Henry from Charles, and therefore attach
  him to the Roman interests, did not require the eloquence of Wolsey to
  make it intelligible. If, because he was in the emperor's power, he
  therefore feared the personal consequences to himself, his cowardice of
  itself disqualified him to sit as a judge.</p>

  <p>It does not fall within my present purpose to detail the first stages
  of the proceedings which followed. In substance they are well known to
  all readers of English history, and may be understood without difficulty
  as soon as we possess the clue to the conduct of Wolsey. I shall,
  however, in a few pages briefly epitomise what passed.</p>

  <p>At the outset of the negotiation, the pope, although he would take no
  positive steps, was all, in words, which he was expected to be. Neither
  he nor the cardinals refused to acknowledge the dangers which threatened
  the country. He discussed freely the position of the different parties,
  the probabilities of a disputed succession, and the various claimants who
  would present themselves, if the king died without an heir of undisputed
  legitimacy.<a name="NtA_135"></a><a href="#Nt_135"><sup>135</sup></a>
  <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
  Gardiner writes to Wolsey,<a name="NtA_136"></a><a
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>136</sup></a> "We did even more inculcate what speed
  and celerity the thing required, and what danger it was to the realm to
  have this matter hang in suspense. His Holiness confessed the same, and
  thereupon began to reckon what divers titles might be pretended by the
  King of Scots and others, and granted that, without an heir male, with
  provision to be made by consent of the state for his succession, and
  unless that what shall be done herein be established in such fashion as
  nothing may hereafter be objected thereto, the realm was like to come to
  dissolution."</p>

  <p>In stronger language the Cardinal-Governor of Bologna declared that
  "he knew the gyze of England as well as few men did, and if the king
  should die without heirs male, he was sure it would cost two hundred
  thousand men's lives. Wherefore he thought, supposing his Grace should
  have no more children by the queen, and that by taking of another wife he
  might have heirs male, the bringing to pass that matter, and by that to
  avoid the mischiefs afore written, he thought would deserve Heaven."<a
  name="NtA_137"></a><a href="#Nt_137"><sup>137</sup></a> Whatever doubt
  their might be, therefore, whether the original marriage with Catherine
  was legal, it was universally admitted that there was none about the
  national desirableness of the dissolution of it; and if the pope had been
  free to judge only by the merits of the case, it is impossible to doubt
  that he would have cut the knot, either by granting a dispensation to
  Henry to marry a second wife&mdash;his first being formally, though not
  judicially, separated from him&mdash;or in some other way.<a
  name="NtA_138"></a><a href="#Nt_138"><sup>138</sup></a> But the emperor
  was "a lion in his path;" the question of strength between the French and
  the Spaniards remained undecided, and Clement would come to no decision
  until he was assured of the power of the allies to protect him from the
  consequences. Accordingly he said and unsaid, sighed, sobbed, beat his
  breast, shuffled, implored, threatened;<a name="NtA_139"></a><a
  href="#Nt_139"><sup>139</sup></a> in all ways he endeavoured to escape
  from his dilemma, to say yes and to say no, to do nothing, to offend no
  one, and above all to gain time, with the weak man's hope that "something
  might happen" to extricate him. Embassy followed embassy from England,
  each using language more threatening than its predecessor. The thing, it
  was said, must be done, and should be done. If it was not done by the
  pope it would be done at home in some <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> other way, and the
  pope must take the consequences.<a name="NtA_140"></a><a
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>140</sup></a> Wolsey warned him passionately of the
  rising storm,<a name="NtA_141"></a><a href="#Nt_141"><sup>141</sup></a> a
  storm which would be so terrible when it burst "that it would be better
  to die than to live." The pope was strangely unable to believe that the
  danger could be real, being misled perhaps by other information from the
  friends of Queen Catherine, and by an over-confidence in the attachment
  of the people to the emperor. He acted throughout in a manner natural to
  a timid amiable man, who found himself in circumstances to which he was
  unequal; and as long as we look at him merely as a man we can pity his
  embarrassment. He forgot, however, that only because he was supposed to
  be more than a man had kings and emperors consented to plead at his
  judgment seat&mdash;a fact of which Stephen Gardiner, then Wolsey's
  secretary, thought it well to remind him in the following striking
  language:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Unless," said the future Bishop of Winchester in the council, at the
  close of a weary day of unprofitable debating, "unless some other
  resolution be taken than I perceive you intend to make, hereupon shall be
  gathered a marvellous opinion of your Holiness, of the college of
  cardinals, and of the authority of this See. The King's Highness, and the
  nobles of the realm who shall be made privy to this, shall needs think
  that your Holiness and these most reverend and learned councillors either
  will not answer in this cause, or cannot answer. If you will not, if you
  do not choose to point out the way to an erring man, the care of whom is
  by God committed to you, they will say, 'Oh race of men most ungrateful,
  and of your proper office most oblivious! You who should be simple as
  doves are full of all deceit, and craft, and dissembling. If the king's
  cause be good, we require that you pronounce it good. If it be bad, why
  will you not say that it is bad, so to hinder a prince to whom you are so
  much bounden <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> from longer continuing with it? We ask
  nothing of you but justice, which the king so loves and values, that
  whatever sinister things others may say or think of him, he will follow
  that with all his heart; that, and nothing else, whether it be for the
  marriage or against the marriage.'</p>

  <p>"But if the King's Majesty," continued Gardiner, hitting the very
  point of the difficulty, "if the King's Majesty and the nobility of
  England, being persuaded of your good will to answer if you can do so,
  shall be brought to doubt of your ability, they will be forced to a
  harder conclusion respecting this See&mdash;namely, that God has taken
  from it the key of knowledge; and they will begin to give better ear to
  that opinion of some persons to which they have as yet refused to listen,
  that those papal laws which neither the pope himself nor his council can
  interpret, deserve only to be committed to the flames." "I desired his
  Holiness," he adds, "to ponder well this matter."<a name="NtA_142"></a><a
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>

  <p>Clement was no hero, but in his worst embarrassments his wit never
  failed him. He answered that he was not learned, and "to speak truth,
  albeit there was a saying in the canon law, that <i>Pontifex habet omnia
  jura in scrinio pectoris</i> (the pope has all laws locked within his
  breast), yet God had never given him the key to open that lock." He was
  but "seeking pretexts" for delay, as Gardiner saw, till the issue of the
  Italian campaign of the French in the summer of 1528 was decided. He had
  been liberated, or had been allowed to escape from Rome, in the fear that
  if detained longer he might nominate a vicegerent; and was residing at an
  old ruined castle at Orvieto, waiting upon events, leaving the Holy City
  still occupied by the Prince of Orange. In the preceding autumn,
  immediately after the congress at Amiens, M. de Lautrec, accompanied by
  several English noblemen, had led an army across the Alps. He had
  defeated the Imperialists in the north of Italy in several minor
  engagements; and in January his success appeared so probable, that the
  pope took better heart, and told Sir Gregory Cassalis, that if the French
  would only approach near enough to enable him to plead compulsion, he
  would grant a commission to Wolsey, with plenary power to conclude the
  cause.<a name="NtA_143"></a><a href="#Nt_143"><sup>143</sup></a> De
  Lautrec, however, <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> foiled in his desire to bring the
  Imperialists to a decisive engagement, wasted his time and strength in
  ineffectual petty sieges; and finally, in the summer, on the unhealthy
  plains of Naples, a disaster more fatal in its consequences than the
  battle of Pavia, closed the prospects of the French to the south of the
  Alps; and with them all Wolsey's hopes of realising his dream. Struck
  down, not by a visible enemy, but by the silent hand of fever, the French
  general himself, his English friends, and all his army melted away from
  off the earth. The pope had been wise in time. He had committed himself
  in words and intentions; but he had done nothing which he could not
  recall. He obtained his pardon from the emperor by promising to offend no
  more; and from that moment never again entertained any real thought of
  concession. Acting under explicit directions, he made it his object
  thenceforward to delay and to procrastinate. Charles had no desire to
  press matters to extremities. War had not yet been declared<a
  name="NtA_144"></a><a href="#Nt_144"><sup>144</sup></a> against him by
  Henry; nor was he anxious <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> himself to precipitate a quarrel from
  which, if possible, he would gladly escape. He had a powerful party in
  England, which it was unwise to alienate by hasty, injudicious measures;
  and he could gain all which he himself desired by a simple policy of
  obstruction. His object was merely to protract the negotiation and
  prevent a decision, in the hope either that Henry would be wearied into
  acquiescence, or that Catherine herself would retire of her own accord,
  or, finally, that some happy accident might occur to terminate the
  difficulty. It is, indeed, much to the honour of Charles V. that he
  resolved to support the queen. She had thrown herself on his protection;
  but princes in such matters consider prudence more than feeling, and he
  could gain nothing by defending her: while, both for himself and for the
  church he risked the loss of much. He over-rated the strength of his
  English connection, and mistook the English character; but he was not
  blind to the hazard which he was incurring, and would have welcomed an
  escape from the dilemma perhaps as warmly as Henry would have welcomed it
  himself. The pope, who well knew his feelings, told Gardiner, "It would
  be for the wealth of Christendom if the queen were in her grave; and he
  thought the emperor would be thereof most glad of all;" saying, also,
  "that he thought like as the emperor had destroyed the temporalities of
  the church, so should she be the destruction of the spiritualities."<a
  name="NtA_145"></a><a href="#Nt_145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the summer of 1528, before the disaster at Naples, Cardinal
  Campeggio had left Rome on his way to England, where he was to hear the
  cause in conjunction with Wolsey. An initial measure of this obvious kind
  it had been impossible to refuse; and the pretexts under which it was for
  many months delayed, were exhausted before the pope's ultimate course had
  been made clear to him. But Campeggio was instructed to protract his
  journey to its utmost length, giving time for the campaign to decide
  itself. He loitered into the autumn, under the excuse of gout and other
  convenient accidents, until the news reached him of De Lautrec's death,
  which took place on the 21st of August; and then at length proceeding, he
  betrayed to Francis I., on passing through Paris, that he had no
  intention of allowing judgment to be passed upon the cause.<a
  name="NtA_146"></a><a href="#Nt_146"><sup>146</sup></a> Even Wolsey was
  beginning to tremble at what he had attempted, and was doubtful <!-- Page
  91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span> of
  success.<a name="NtA_147"></a><a href="#Nt_147"><sup>147</sup></a> The
  seeming relief came in time, for Henry's patience was fast running out.
  He had been over-persuaded into a course which he had never cordially
  approved. The majority of the council, especially the Duke of Norfolk and
  the Duke of Suffolk, were traditionally imperial, and he himself might
  well doubt whether he might not have found a nearer road out of his
  difficulties by adhering to Charles. Charles, after all, was not ruining
  the papacy, and had no intention of ruining it; and his lightest word
  weighed more at the court of Rome than the dubious threats and prayers of
  France. The Bishop of Bayonne, resident French ambassador in London,
  whose remarkable letters transport us back into the very midst of that
  unquiet and stormy scene, tells us plainly that the French alliance was
  hated by the country, that the nobility were all for the emperor, and
  that among the commons the loudest discontent was openly expressed
  against Wolsey from the danger of the interruption of the trade with
  Flanders. Flemish ships had been detained in London, and English ships in
  retaliation had been arrested in the Zealand ports; corn was unusually
  dear, and the expected supplies from Spain and Germany were cut off;<a
  name="NtA_148"></a><a href="#Nt_148"><sup>148</sup></a> while the
  derangement of the woollen trade, from the reluctance of the merchants to
  venture purchases, was causing distress all over the country, and Wolsey
  had been driven to the most arbitrary measures to prevent open
  disturbance.<a name="NtA_149"></a><a href="#Nt_149"><sup>149</sup></a> He
  had set his hopes upon the chance of a single cast which he would not
  believe could fail him, but on each fresh delay he was compelled to feel
  his declining credit, and the Bishop of Bayonne wrote, on the 20th of
  August, 1528, that the cardinal was in bad spirits, and had told him in
  confidence, that "if he could only see the <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> divorce arranged, the
  king remarried, the succession settled, and the laws and the manners and
  customs of the country reformed, he would retire from the world and would
  serve God the remainder of his days."<a name="NtA_150"></a><a
  href="#Nt_150"><sup>150</sup></a> To these few trifles he would be
  contented to confine himself&mdash;only to these; he was past sixty, he
  was weary of the world, and his health was breaking, and he would limit
  his hopes to the execution of a work for which centuries imperfectly
  sufficed. It seemed as if he measured his stature by the lengthening
  shadow, as his sun made haste to its setting. Symptoms of misgiving may
  be observed in the many anxious letters which he wrote while Campeggio
  was so long upon his road; and the Bishop of Bayonne, whose less
  interested eyes could see more deeply into the game, warned him
  throughout that the pope was playing him false.<a name="NtA_151"></a><a
  href="#Nt_151"><sup>151</sup></a> Only in a revulsion from violent
  despondency could such a man as Wolsey have allowed himself, on the mere
  arrival of the legate, and after a few soft words from him, to write in
  the following strain to Sir Gregory Cassalis:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You cannot believe the exultation with which at length I find myself
  successful in the object for which these many years, with all my
  industry, I have laboured. At length I have found means to bind my most
  excellent sovereign and this glorious realm to the holy Roman see in
  faith and obedience for ever. Henceforth will this people become the most
  sure pillar of support to bear up the sacred fabric of the church.
  Henceforth, in recompense for that enduring felicity which he has secured
  to it, our most Holy Lord has all England at his devotion. In brief time
  will this noble land make its grateful acknowledgments to his clemency at
  once for the preservation of the most just, most wise, most excellent of
  princes, and for the secure establishment of the realm and the protection
  of the royal succession."<a name="NtA_152"></a><a
  href="#Nt_152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>

  <p>This letter was dated on the fourth of October, and was written in the
  hope that the pope had collected his courage, and that the legate had
  brought powers to proceed to judgment. In a few days the prospect was
  again clouded, and Wolsey was once more in despair.<a
  name="NtA_153"></a><a href="#Nt_153"><sup>153</sup></a> Campeggio had
  brought with him instructions if possible to arrange a
  compromise,&mdash;if a compromise <!-- Page 93 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> was impossible, to
  make the best use of his ingenuity, and do nothing and allow nothing to
  be done. In one of two ways, however, it was hoped that he might effect a
  peaceful solution. He urged the king to give way and to proceed no
  further; and this failing, as he was prepared to find, he urged the same
  thing upon the queen.<a name="NtA_154"></a><a
  href="#Nt_154"><sup>154</sup></a> He invited Catherine, or he was
  directed to invite her, in the pope's name,<a name="NtA_155"></a><a
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>155</sup></a> for the sake of the general interests
  of Christendom, to take the vows and enter what was called <i>religio
  laxa</i>, a state in which she might live unincumbered by obligations
  except the easy one of chastity, and free from all other restrictions
  either of habit, diet, or order. The proposal was Wolsey's, and was
  formed when he found the limited nature of Campeggio's instructions;<a
  name="NtA_156"></a><a href="#Nt_156"><sup>156</sup></a> but it was
  adopted by the latter; and I cannot but think (though I have no proof of
  it) that it was not adopted without the knowledge of the emperor.
  Whatever were his own interests, Charles V. gave Catherine his unwavering
  support: he made it his duty to maintain her in the ignominious position
  in which she was placed, and submitted his own conduct to be guided by
  her wishes. It cannot be doubted, however, from the pope's words, and
  also from the circumstances of the case, that if she could have prevailed
  upon herself to yield, it would have relieved him from a painful
  embarrassment. As a prince, he must have felt the substantial justice of
  Henry's demand, and in refusing to allow the pope to pass a judicial
  sentence of divorce, he could not but have known that he was compromising
  the position of the Holy See: while Catherine herself, on the other hand,
  if she had yielded, would have retired without a stain; no opinion would
  have been pronounced upon her marriage; the legitimacy of the Princess
  Mary would have been left without impeachment; and her right to the
  succession, in the event of no male heir following from any new
  connection which the king might form, would have been readily secured to
  her by act of parliament. It may be asked why she did not yield, and it
  is difficult to answer the question. She was not a person who would have
  been disturbed by the loss of a few court vanities. Her situation as
  Henry's wife could not have had many charms for her, nor can it be
  thought that she retained a personal affection for him. If she had loved
  him, she would have suffered too deeply in the struggle to have continued
  to resist, and the cloister would have seemed a paradise. Or if the
  cloister had appeared too sad a shelter for her, she might have gone back
  to the gardens of the <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> Alhambra, where she had played as a
  child, carrying with her the affectionate remembrance of every English
  heart, and welcomed by her own people as an injured saint. Nor again can
  we suppose that the possible injury of her daughter's prospects from the
  birth of a prince by another marriage could have seemed of so vast moment
  to her. Those prospects were already more than endangered, and would have
  been rather improved than brought into further peril.</p>

  <p>It is not for us to dictate the conduct which a woman smarting under
  injuries so cruel ought to have pursued. She had a right to choose the
  course which seemed the best to herself, and England especially could not
  claim of a stranger that readiness to sacrifice herself which it might
  have demanded and exacted of one of its own children. We may regret,
  however, what we are unable to censure; and the most refined ingenuity
  could scarcely have invented a more unfortunate answer than that which
  the Queen returned to the legate's request. She seems to have said that
  she was ready to take vows of chastity if the king would do the same. It
  does not appear whether the request was <i>formally</i> made, or whether
  it was merely suggested to her in private conversation. That she told the
  legates, however, what her answer would be, appears certain from the
  following passage, sadly indicating the "devices of policy" to which in
  this unhappy business honourable men allowed themselves to be
  driven:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Forasmuch as it is like that the queen shall make marvellous
  difficulty, and in nowise be conformable to enter religion<a
  name="NtA_157"></a><a href="#Nt_157"><sup>157</sup></a> or take vows of
  chastity, but that to induce her thereunto, there must be ways and means
  of high policy used, and all things possible devised to encourage her to
  the same; wherein percase she shall resolve that she in no wise will
  condescend so to do, unless that the King's Highness also do the
  semblable for his part; the king's said orators shall therefore in like
  wise ripe and instruct themselves by their secret learned council in the
  court of Rome, if, for so great a benefit to ensue unto the king's
  succession, realm, and subjects, with the quiet of his conscience, his
  Grace should promise so to enter religion on vows of chastity for his
  part, only thereby to conduce the queen thereunto, whether in that case
  the Pope's Holiness may dispense with the King's Highness for the same
  promise, oath, or vow, discharging his Grace clearly of the same."<a
  name="NtA_158"></a><a href="#Nt_158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>

  <p>The explanation of the queen's conduct lies probably in regions into
  which it is neither easy nor well to penetrate; in regions of outraged
  delicacy and wounded pride, in a vast drama of passion which had been
  enacted behind the scenes. From the significant hints which are let fall
  of the original cause of the estrangement, it was of a kind more
  difficult to endure than the ordinary trial of married women, the
  transfer of a husband's affection to some fairer face; and a wife whom so
  painful a misfortune had failed to crush would be likely to have been
  moved by it to a deeper and more bitter indignation even, because while
  she could not blame herself, she knew not whom she might rightly allow
  herself to blame. And if this were so, the king is not likely to have
  allayed the storm when at length, putting faith in Wolsey's promises, he
  allowed himself openly to regard another person as his future wife,
  establishing her in the palace at Greenwich under the same roof with the
  queen, with reception rooms, and royal state, and a position openly
  acknowledged,<a name="NtA_159"></a><a href="#Nt_159"><sup>159</sup></a>
  the gay court and courtiers forsaking the gloomy dignity of the actual
  wife for the gaudy splendour of her brilliant rival. Tamer blood than
  that which flowed in the veins of a princess of Castile would have boiled
  under these indignities; and we have little reason to be surprised if
  policy and prudence were alike forgotten by Catherine in the bitterness
  of the draught which was forced upon her, and if her own personal wrongs
  outweighed the interests of the world. Henry had proceeded to the last
  unjustifiable extremity as soon as the character of Campeggio's mission
  had been made clear to him, as if to demonstrate to all the world that he
  was determined to persevere at all costs and hazards.<a
  name="NtA_160"></a><a href="#Nt_160"><sup>160</sup></a> Taking the
  management of the negotiation into his own keeping, he sent Sir Francis
  Bryan, the cousin of Anne Boleyn, to the pope, to announce that what he
  required must be done, and to declare peremptorily, no more with covert
  hints, but with open menace, that in default of help from Rome, he would
  lay the matter before parliament, to be settled at home by the laws of
  his own country.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the emperor, who had hitherto conducted himself with the
  greatest address, had fallen into his first error. He had retreated
  skilfully out of the embarrassment in which the pope's imprisonment
  involved him, and mingling authority and dictation with kindness and
  deference, he had won over the Holy See to his devotion, and neutralised
  the danger to which the alliance <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> of France and England threatened to
  expose him. His correspondence with the latter country assured him of the
  unpopularity of the course which had been pursued by the cardinal; he was
  aware of the obstruction of trade which it had caused, and of the general
  displeasure felt by the people at the breach of an old friendship; while
  the league with France in behalf of the Roman church had been barren of
  results, and was made ridiculous by the obvious preference of the pope
  for the enemy from whom it was formed to deliver him. If Charles had
  understood the English temper, therefore, and had known how to avail
  himself of the opportunity, events might have run in a very different
  channel. But he was not aware of the earnestness with which the people
  were bent upon securing the succession, nor of their loyal attachment to
  Henry. He supposed that disapproval of the course followed by Wolsey to
  obtain the divorce implied an aversion to it altogether; and trusting to
  his interest in the privy council, and to his commercial connection with
  the city, he had attempted to meet menace with menace; he had replied to
  the language addressed by Henry to the pope with an attempt to feel the
  pulse of English disaffection, and he opened a correspondence with the
  Earl of Desmond for an Irish revolt.<a name="NtA_161"></a><a
  href="#Nt_161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>

  <p>The opportunity for a movement of this kind had not yet arrived. There
  was, in England at least, as yet no wide disaffection; but there was a
  chance of serious outbreaks; and Henry instantly threw himself upon the
  nation. He summoned the peers by circular to London, and calling a
  general meeting, composed of the nobility, the privy council, the lord
  mayor, and the great merchants of the city, he laid before them a
  specific detail of his objects in desiring the divorce;<a
  name="NtA_162"></a><a href="#Nt_162"><sup>162</sup></a> and informed them
  <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
  of the nature of the measures which had been taken.<a
  name="NtA_163"></a><a href="#Nt_163"><sup>163</sup></a> This, the French
  ambassador informs us, gave wide satisfaction and <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> served much to allay
  the disquiet; but so great was the indignation against Wolsey, that
  disturbances in London were every day anticipated; and at one time the
  danger appeared so threatening, that an order of council was issued,
  commanding all strangers to leave the city, and a general search was
  instituted for arms.<a name="NtA_164"></a><a
  href="#Nt_164"><sup>164</sup></a> The strangers aimed at were the
  Flemings, whose numbers made them formidable, and who were, perhaps,
  supposed to be ready to act under instruction from abroad. The cloud,
  however, cleared away; the order was not enforced; and the propitious
  moment for treason had not yet arrived. The emperor had felt so confident
  that, in the autumn of 1528, he had boasted that, "before the winter was
  over, he would fling Henry from his throne by the hands of his own
  Subjects." The words had been repeated to Wolsey, who mentioned them
  openly at his table before more than a hundred gentlemen. A person
  present exclaimed, "That speech has lost the emperor more than a hundred
  thousand hearts among us;"<a name="NtA_165"></a><a
  href="#Nt_165"><sup>165</sup></a> an expression which reveals at once the
  strength and the weakness of the imperial party. England might have its
  own opinions of the policy of the government, but it was in no humour to
  tolerate treason, and the first hint of revolt was followed by an instant
  recoil. The discovery of more successful intrigues in Scotland and
  Ireland completed the destruction of Charles's influence;<a
  name="NtA_166"></a><a href="#Nt_166"><sup>166</sup></a> and the result of
  these ill-judged and premature efforts was merely to unite the nation in
  their determination to prosecute the divorce.</p>

  <p>Thus were the various parties in the vast struggle which was about to
  commence gravitating into their places; and mistake combined with policy
  to place them in their true positions. Wolsey, in submitting "the king's
  matter" to the pope, had brought to issue the question whether the papal
  authority should be any longer recognised in England; and he had secured
  the ruin of that authority by the steps through which he hoped to
  establish it; while Charles, by his unwise endeavours to foment a
  rebellion, severed with his own hand the links of a friendship which
  would have been seriously embarrassing if it had continued. By him, also,
  was dealt the concluding stroke in this first act of the drama; and
  though we may grant him credit for the ingenuity of his contrivance, he
  can claim it only at the expense of his probity. The pope, when the
  commission was appointed for the trial of the cause in England, had given
  a promise in writing that the commission <!-- Page 99 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> should not be
  revoked. It seemed, therefore, that the legates would be compelled, in
  spite of themselves, to pronounce sentence; and that the settlement of
  the question, in one form or other, could not long be delayed. At the
  pressure of the crisis in the winter of 1528-9, a document was produced
  alleged to have been found in Spain, which furnished a pretext for a
  recall of the engagement, and opening now questions, indefinite and
  inexhaustible, rendered the passing of a sentence in England impossible.
  Unhappily, the weight of the king's claim (however it had been rested on
  its true merits in conversation and in letters) had, by the perverse
  ingenuity of the lawyers, been laid on certain informalities and defects
  in the original bull of dispensation, which had been granted by Julius
  II. for the marriage of Henry and Catherine. At the moment when the
  legates' court was about to be opened, a copy of a brief was brought
  forward, bearing the same date as the bull, exactly meeting the
  objection. The authenticity of this brief was open, on its own merits, to
  grave doubt; and suspicion becomes certainty when we find it was dropped
  out of the controversy so soon as the immediate object was gained for
  which it was produced. But the legates' hands were instantly tied by it.
  The "previous question" of authenticity had necessarily to be tried
  before they could take another step; and the "original" of the brief
  being in the hands of the emperor, who refused to send it into England,
  but offered to send it to Rome, the cause was virtually transferred to
  Rome, where Henry, as he knew, was unlikely to consent to plead, or where
  he could himself rule the decision. He had made a stroke of political
  finesse, which answered not only the purpose that he immediately
  intended, but answered, also, the purpose that he did not intend&mdash;of
  dealing the hardest blow which it had yet received to the supremacy of
  the Holy See.</p>

  <p>The spring of 1529 was wasted in fruitless efforts to obtain the
  brief. At length, in May, the proceedings were commenced; but they were
  commenced only in form, and were never more than an illusion. Catherine
  had been instructed in the course which she was to pursue. She appealed
  from the judgment of the legates to that of the pope; and the pope, with
  the plea of the new feature which had arisen in the case, declared that
  he could not refuse to revoke his promise. Having consented to the
  production of the brief, he had in fact no alternative; nor does it
  appear what he could have urged in excuse of himself. He may have
  suspected the forgery; nay, it is certain that in <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> England he was
  believed to be privy to it; but he could not ignore an important feature
  of necessary evidence, especially when pressed upon him by the emperor;
  and it was in fact no more than an absurdity to admit the authority of a
  papal commission, and to refuse to permit an appeal from it to the pope
  in person. We may thank Clement for dispelling a chimera by a simple act
  of consistency. The power of the See of Rome in England was a
  constitutional fiction, acknowledged only on condition that it would
  consent to be inert. So long as a legate's court sat in London, men were
  able to conceal from themselves the fact of a foreign jurisdiction, and
  to feel that, substantially, their national independence was respected;
  when the fiction aspired to become a reality, but one consequence was
  possible. If Henry himself would have stooped to plead at a foreign
  tribunal, the spirit of the nation would not have permitted him to
  inflict so great a dishonour on the free majesty of England.</p>

  <p>So fell Wolsey's great scheme, and with it fell the last real chance
  of maintaining the pope's authority in England under any form. The people
  were smarting under the long humiliation of the delay, and ill-endured to
  see the interests of England submitted, as they virtually were, to the
  arbitration of a foreign prince. The emperor, not the pope, was the true
  judge who sat to decide the quarrel; and their angry jealousy refused to
  tolerate longer a national dishonour.</p>

  <p>"The great men of the realm," wrote the legates, "are storming in
  bitter wrath at our procrastination. Lords and commons alike complain
  that they are made to expect at the hands of strangers things of vital
  moment to themselves and their fortunes. And many persons here who would
  desire to see the pope's authority in this country diminished or
  annulled, are speaking in language which we cannot repeat without
  horror."<a name="NtA_167"></a><a href="#Nt_167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>

  <p>And when, being in such a mood, they were mocked, after two weary
  years of negotiation, by the opening of a fresh vista of difficulties,
  when they were informed that the further hearing of the cause was
  transferred to Italy, even Wolsey, with certain ruin before him, rose in
  protest before such a dream of shame. He was no more the Roman legate,
  but the English minister.</p>

  <p>"If the advocation be passed," he wrote to Cassalis,<a
  name="NtA_168"></a><a href="#Nt_168"><sup>168</sup></a> "or shall now at
  any time hereafter pass, with citation of the king in person, or by
  proctor, to the court of Rome, or with any <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> clause of
  interdiction or excommunication, <i>vel cum invocatione brachii
  sæcularis</i>, whereby the king should be precluded from taking his
  advantage otherwise, the dignity and prerogative royal of the king's
  crown, whereunto all the nobles and subjects of this realm will adhere
  and stick unto the death, may not tolerate nor suffer that the same be
  obeyed. And to say the truth, in so doing the pope should not only show
  himself the king's enemy, but also as much as in him is, provoke all
  other princes and people to be the semblable. Nor shall it ever be seen
  that the king's cause shall be ventilated or decided in any place out of
  his own realm; <i>but that if his Grace should come at any time to the
  Court of Rome, he would do the same with such a main and army royal as
  should be formidable to the pope and all Italy</i>."<a
  name="NtA_169"></a><a href="#Nt_169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>

  <p>Wolsey, however, failed in his protest; the advocation was passed,
  Campeggio left England, and he was lost. A crisis had arrived, and a
  revolution of policy was inevitable. From the accession of Henry VII.,
  the country had been governed by a succession of ecclesiastical
  ministers, who being priests as well as statesmen, were essentially
  conservative; and whose efforts in a position of constantly increasing
  difficulty had been directed towards resisting the changing tendencies of
  the age, and either evading a reformation of the church while they
  admitted its necessity, or retaining the conduct of it in their own
  hands, while <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> they were giving evidence of their
  inability to accomplish the work. It was now over; the ablest
  representative of this party, in a last desperate effort to retain power,
  had decisively failed. Writs were issued for a parliament when the
  legate's departure was determined, and the consequences were inevitable.
  Wolsey had known too well the unpopularity of his foreign policy, to
  venture on calling a parliament himself. He relied on success as an
  ultimate justification; and inasmuch as success had not followed, he was
  obliged to bear the necessary fate of a minister who, in a free country,
  had thwarted the popular will and whom fortune deserted in the struggle.
  The barriers which his single hand had upheld suddenly gave way, the
  torrent had free course, and he himself was the first to be swept away.
  In modern language, we should describe what took place as a change of
  ministry, the government being transferred to an opposition, who had been
  irritated by long depression under the hands of men whom they despised,
  and who were borne into power by an irresistible force in a moment of
  excitement and danger. The king, who had been persuaded against his
  better judgment to accept Wolsey's schemes, admitted the rising spirit
  without reluctance, contented to moderate its action, but no longer
  obstructing or permitting it to be obstructed. Like all great English
  statesmen, he was constitutionally conservative, but he had the tact to
  perceive the conditions under which, in critical times, conservatism is
  possible; and although he continued to endure for himself the trifling of
  the papacy, he would not, for the sake of the pope's interest, delay
  further the investigation of the complaints of the people against the
  church; while in the future prosecution of his own cause, he resolved to
  take no steps except with the consent of the legislature, and in a
  question of national moment, to consult only the nation's wishes.</p>

  <p>The new ministry held a middle place between the moving party in the
  commons and the expelled ecclesiastics, the principal members of it being
  the chief representatives of the old aristocracy, who had been Wolsey's
  fiercest opponents, but who were disinclined by constitution and sympathy
  from sweeping measures. An attempt was made, indeed, to conciliate the
  more old-fashioned of the churchmen, by an offer of the seals to Warham,
  Archbishop of Canterbury, probably because he originally opposed the
  marriage between the king and his sister-in-law, and because it was hoped
  that his objections remained unaltered. Warham, however, as we shall see,
  had changed his mind: he declined, on the plea of age, and the <!-- Page
  103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> office
  of chancellor was given to Sir Thomas More, perhaps the person least
  disaffected to the clergy who could have been found among the leading
  laymen. The substance of power was vested in the Dukes of Norfolk and
  Suffolk, the great soldier-nobles of the age, and Sir William
  Fitz-William, lord admiral; to all of whom the ecclesiastical domination
  had been most intolerable, while they had each of them brilliantly
  distinguished themselves in the wars with France and Scotland. According
  to the French ambassador, we must add one more minister, supreme, if we
  may trust him, above them all. "The Duke of Norfolk," he writes, "is made
  president of the council, the Duke of Suffolk vice-president, and above
  them both is Mistress Anne;"<a name="NtA_170"></a><a
  href="#Nt_170"><sup>170</sup></a> this last addition to the council being
  one which boded little good to the interests of the See that had so long
  detained her in expectation. So confident were the destructive party of
  the temper of the approaching parliament, and of the irresistible
  pressure of the times, that the general burden of conversation of the
  dinner-tables in the great houses in London was an exulting expectation
  of a dissolution of the church establishment, and a confiscation of
  ecclesiastical property; the king himself being the only obstacle which
  was feared by them. "These noble lords imagine," continues the same
  writer, "that the cardinal once dead of ruined, they will incontinently
  plunder the church, and strip it of all its wealth," adding that there
  was no occasion for him to write this in cipher, for it was everywhere
  openly spoken of.<a name="NtA_171"></a><a
  href="#Nt_171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>

  <p>Movements, nevertheless, which are pregnant with vital change, are
  slow in assuming their essential direction, even after the stir has
  commenced. Circumstances do not immediately open themselves; the point of
  vision alters gradually; and fragments of old opinions, and
  prepossessions, and prejudices remain interfused with the new, even in
  the clearest minds, and cannot at a moment be shaken off. Only the unwise
  change suddenly; and we can never too often remind ourselves, when we see
  men stepping forward with uncertainty and hesitation over a road, where
  to us, we know the actual future, all seems so plain, that the road
  looked different to the actors themselves, who were beset with
  imaginations of the past, and to whom the gloom of the future appeared
  thronged with phantoms of possible contingencies. The hasty expectations
  of the noble lords were checked by Henry's prudence; and though parties
  were rapidly arranging themselves, there was <!-- Page 104 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> still confusion.
  The city, though disinclined to the pope and the church, continued to
  retain an inclination for the emperor; and the pope had friends among
  Wolsey's enemies, who, by his overthrow, were pressed forward into
  prominence, and divided the victory with the reformers. The presence of
  Sir Thomas More in the council was a guarantee that no exaggerated
  measures against the church would be permitted so long as he held the
  seals; and Henry, perhaps, was anxious to leave room for conciliation,
  which he hoped that the pope would desire as much as himself, so soon as
  the meeting of parliament had convinced him that the mutinous disposition
  of the nation had not been overstated by his own and Wolsey's
  letters.</p>

  <p>The impression conceived two years before of the hostile relations
  between the pope and Charles had not yet been wholly effaced; and even as
  late as September, 1529, after the closing of the legates' court, in the
  very heat of the public irritation, there were persons who believed that
  when Clement met his imperial captor face to face, and the interview had
  taken place which had been arranged for the ensuing January, his eyes
  would be opened, and that he would fall back upon England.<a
  name="NtA_172"></a><a href="#Nt_172"><sup>172</sup></a> At the same time,
  the incongruities in the constitution of the council became so early
  apparent, that their agreement was thought impossible, and Wolsey's
  return to power was discussed openly as a probability<a
  name="NtA_173"></a><a href="#Nt_173"><sup>173</sup></a>&mdash;a result
  which Anne Boleyn, who, better than any other person, knew the king's
  feelings, never ceased to fear, till, a year after his disgrace, the
  welcome news were brought to her that he had sunk into his long rest,
  where the sick load of office and of obloquy would gall his back no
  more.</p>

  <p>There was a third party in the country, unconsidered as yet, who had a
  part to play in the historical drama: a party which, indeed, if any one
  had known it, was the most important of all; the only one which, in a
  true, high sense, was of importance at all; and for the sake of which,
  little as it then appeared to be so, the whole work was to be
  done&mdash;composed at that time merely of poor men, poor cobblers,
  weavers, carpenters, trade apprentices, and humble artisans, men of low
  birth and low estate, who might be seen at night stealing along the lanes
  and alleys of London, carrying with them some precious load of books
  which it was death to possess; and giving their lives gladly, if it must
  be so, for the brief tenure of so dear a treasure. These men, for the
  present, were likely to fare ill from the new <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> ministry. They were
  the disturbers of order, the anarchists, the men disfigured <i>pravitate
  hereticâ</i>, by monstrous doctrines, and consequently by monstrous
  lives&mdash;who railed at authorities, and dared to read New Testaments
  with their own eyes&mdash;who, consequently, by their excesses and
  extravagances, brought discredit upon liberal opinions, and whom moderate
  liberals (as they always have done, and always will do while human nature
  remains itself) held it necessary for their credit's sake to persecute,
  that a censorious world might learn to make no confusion between true
  wisdom and the folly which seemed to resemble it. The Protestants had not
  loved Wolsey, and they had no reason to love him; but it was better to
  bear a fagot of dry sticks in a procession when the punishment was
  symbolic, than, lashed fast to a stake in Smithfield, amidst piles of the
  same fagots kindled into actual flames, to sink into a heap of blackened
  dust and ashes; and before a year had passed, they would gladly have
  accepted again the hated cardinal, to escape from the philosophic mercies
  of Sir Thomas More. The number of English Protestants at this time it is
  difficult to conjecture. The importance of such men is not to be measured
  by counting heads. In 1526, they were organised into a society, calling
  themselves "the Christian brotherhood,"<a name="NtA_174"></a><a
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>174</sup></a> with a central committee sitting in
  London; with subscribed funds, regularly audited, for the purchase of
  Testaments and tracts; and with paid agents, who travelled up and down
  the country to distribute them. Some of the poorer clergy belonged to the
  society;<a name="NtA_175"></a><a href="#Nt_175"><sup>175</sup></a> and
  among the city merchants there were many well inclined to it, and who,
  perhaps, attended its meetings "by night, secretly, for fear of the
  Jews." But, as a rule, "property and influence" continued to hold aloof
  in the usual haughty style, and the pioneers of the new opinions had yet
  to win their way along a scorched and blackened path of suffering, before
  the State would consent to acknowledge them. We think bitterly of these
  things, and yet we are but quarrelling with what is inevitable from the
  constitution of the world. New doctrines ever gain readiest hearing among
  the common people; not only because the interests of the higher classes
  are usually in some degree connected with the maintenance of existing
  institutions; but because ignorance is itself a protection against the
  many considerations which embarrass the judgment of the educated. <!--
  Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
  The value of a doctrine cannot be determined on its own apparent merits
  by men whose habits of mind are settled in other forms; while men of
  experience know well that out of the thousands of theories which rise in
  the fertile soil below them, it is but one here and one there which grows
  to maturity; and the precarious chances of possible vitality, where the
  opposite probabilities are so enormous, oblige them to discourage and
  repress opinions which threaten to disturb established order, or which,
  by the rules of existing beliefs, imperil the souls of those who
  entertain them. Persecution has ceased among ourselves, because we do not
  any more believe that want of theoretic orthodoxy in matters of faith is
  necessarily fraught with the tremendous consequences which once were
  supposed to be attached to it. If, however, a school of Thugs were to
  rise among us, making murder a religious service; if they gained
  proselytes, and the proselytes put their teaching in execution, we should
  speedily begin again to persecute opinion. What teachers of Thuggism
  would appear to ourselves, the teachers of heresy actually appeared to
  Sir Thomas More, only being as much more hateful as the eternal death of
  the soul is more terrible than the single and momentary separation of it
  from the body. There is, I think, no just ground on which to condemn
  conscientious Catholics on the score of persecution, except only this:
  that as we are now convinced of the injustice of the persecuting laws, so
  among those who believed them to be just, there were some who were led by
  an instinctive protest of human feeling to be lenient in the execution of
  those laws; while others of harder nature and more narrow sympathies
  enforced them without reluctance, and even with exultation. The heart,
  when it is rightly constituted, corrects the folly of the head; and wise
  good men, even though they entertain no conscious misgiving as to the
  soundness of their theories, may be delivered from the worst consequences
  of those theories, by trusting their more genial instincts. And thus, and
  thus only, are we justified in censuring those whose names figure largely
  in the persecuting lists. Their defence is impregnable to logic. We blame
  them for the absence of that humanity which is deeper than logic, and
  which should have taught them to refuse the conclusions of their
  speculative creed.</p>

  <p>Such, then, was the state of parties in the autumn of 1529. The old
  conservatives, the political ecclesiastics, had ceased to exist, and the
  clergy as a body were paralysed by corruption. There remained&mdash;</p>

<!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>

  <p>The English party who had succeeded to power, and who were bent upon a
  secular revolt.</p>

  <p>The papal party, composed of theoretic theologians, like Fisher,
  Bishop of Rochester, and represented on the council by Sir Thomas
  More.</p>

  <p>And both of these were united in their aversion to the third party,
  that of the doctrinal Protestants, who were still called heretics.</p>

  <p>These three substantially divided what was sound in England; the first
  composed of the mass of the people, representing the principles of
  prudence, justice, good sense, and the working faculties of social life:
  the two last sharing between them the higher qualities of nobleness,
  enthusiasm, self-devotion; but in their faith being without discretion,
  and in their piety without understanding. The problem of the Reformation
  was to reunite virtues which could be separated only to their mutual
  confusion; and to work out among them such inadequate reconciliation as
  the wilfulness of human nature would allow.</p>

  <p>Before I close this chapter, which is intended as a general
  introduction, I have to say something of two prominent persons whose
  character antecedent to the actions in which we are to find them engaged
  it is desirable that we should understand; I mean Henry VIII. himself,
  and the lady whom he had selected to fill the place from which Catherine
  of Arragon was to be deposed.</p>

  <p>If Henry VIII. had died previous to the first agitation of the
  divorce, his loss would have been deplored as one of the heaviest
  misfortunes which had ever befallen the country; and he would have left a
  name which would have taken its place in history by the side of that of
  the Black Prince or of the conqueror of Agincourt. Left at the most
  trying age, with his character unformed, with the means at his disposal
  of gratifying every inclination, and married by his ministers when a boy
  to an unattractive woman far his senior, he had lived for thirty-six
  years almost without blame, and bore through England the reputation of an
  upright and virtuous king. Nature had been prodigal to him of her rarest
  gifts. In person he is said to have resembled his grandfather, Edward
  IV., who was the handsomest man in Europe. His form and bearing were
  princely; and amidst the easy freedom of his address, his manner remained
  majestic. No knight in England could match him in the tournament except
  the Duke of Suffolk: he drew with ease as strong a bow as was borne by
  any yeoman of his guard; and these <!-- Page 108 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> powers were
  sustained in unfailing vigour by a temperate habit and by constant
  exercise. Of his intellectual ability we are not left to judge from the
  suspicious panegyrics of his contemporaries. His state papers and letters
  may be placed by the side of those of Wolsey or of Cromwell, and they
  lose nothing in the comparison. Though they are broadly different, the
  perception is equally clear, the expression equally powerful, and they
  breathe throughout an irresistible vigour of purpose. In addition to this
  he had a fine musical taste, carefully cultivated; he spoke and wrote in
  four languages; and his knowledge of a multitude of other subjects, with
  which his versatile ability made him conversant, would have formed the
  reputation of any ordinary man. He was among the best physicians of his
  age; he was his own engineer, inventing improvements in artillery, and
  new constructions in ship-building; and this not with the condescending
  incapacity of a royal amateur, but with thorough workmanlike
  understanding. His reading was vast, especially in theology, which has
  been ridiculously ascribed by Lord Herbert to his father's intention of
  educating him for the Archbishopric of Canterbury; as if the scientific
  mastery of such a subject could have been acquired by a boy of twelve
  years of age, for he was no more when he became Prince of Wales. He must
  have studied theology with the full maturity of his intellect; and he had
  a fixed and perhaps unfortunate interest in the subject itself.<a
  name="NtA_176"></a><a href="#Nt_176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>

  <p>In all directions of human activity Henry displayed natural powers of
  the highest order, at the highest stretch of industrious culture. He was
  "attentive," as it is called, "to his religious duties," being present at
  the services in chapel two or three times a day with unfailing
  regularity, and showing to outward appearance a real sense of religious
  obligation in the energy and purity of his life. In private he was
  good-humoured and good-natured. His letters to his secretaries, though
  never undignified, are simple, easy, and unrestrained; and the letters
  written by them to him are similarly plain and businesslike, as if the
  writers knew that the person whom they were addressing disliked
  compliments, and chose to be treated as a man. Again, from their
  correspondence with one another, when they describe interviews with him,
  we gather the same pleasant impression. He seems to have been always
  kind, always considerate; inquiring into their private concerns with
  genuine interest, and winning, as a consequence, their warm and
  unaffected attachment.</p>

  <p>As a ruler he had been eminently popular. All his wars had been
  successful. He had the splendid tastes in which the English people most
  delighted, and he had substantially acted out his own theory of his duty
  which was expressed in the following words:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Scripture taketh princes to be, as it were, fathers and nurses to
  their subjects, and by Scripture it appeareth that it appertaineth unto
  the office of princes to see that right religion and true doctrine be
  maintained and taught, and that their subjects may be well ruled and
  governed by good and just laws; and to provide and care for them that all
  things necessary for them may be plenteous; and that the people and
  commonweal may increase; and to defend them from oppression and invasion,
  as well within the realm as without; and to see that justice be
  administered unto them indifferently; and to hear benignly all their
  complaints; and to show towards them, although they offend, fatherly
  pity. And, finally, so to <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> correct them that be evil, that they
  had yet rather save them than lose them if it were not for respect of
  justice, and maintenance of peace and good order in the commonweal."<a
  name="NtA_177"></a><a href="#Nt_177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

  <p>These principles do really appear to have determined Henry's conduct
  in his earlier years. His social administration we have partially seen in
  the previous chapter. He had more than once been tried with insurrection,
  which he had soothed down without bloodshed, and extinguished in
  forgiveness; and London long recollected the great scene which followed
  "evil May-day," 1517, when the apprentices were brought down to
  Westminster Hall to receive their pardons. There had been a dangerous
  riot in the streets, which might have provoked a mild government to
  severity; but the king contented himself with punishing the five
  ringleaders, and four hundred other prisoners, after being paraded down
  the streets in white shirts with halters round their necks, were
  dismissed with an admonition, Wolsey weeping as he pronounced it.<a
  name="NtA_178"></a><a href="#Nt_178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is certain that if, as I said, he had died before the divorce was
  mooted, Henry VIII., like that Roman Emperor said by Tacitus to have been
  <i>consensu omnium dignus imperii nisi imperasset</i>, would have been
  considered by posterity as formed by Providence for the conduct of the
  Reformation, and his loss would have been deplored as a perpetual
  calamity. We must allow him, therefore, the benefit of his past career,
  and be careful to remember it, when interpreting his later actions. Not
  many men would have borne themselves through the same trials with the
  same integrity; but the circumstances of those trials had not tested the
  true defects in his moral constitution. Like all princes of the
  Plantagenet blood, he was a person of a most intense and imperious will.
  His impulses, in general nobly directed, had never known contradiction;
  and late in life, when his character was formed, he was forced into
  collision with difficulties with which the experience of discipline had
  not fitted him to contend. Education had done much for him, but his
  nature required more correction than his position had permitted, whilst
  unbroken prosperity and early independence of control had been his most
  serious misfortune. He had capacity, if his training had been equal to
  it, to be one of the greatest of men. With all his faults about him, he
  was still <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> perhaps the greatest of his
  contemporaries; and the man best able of all living Englishmen to govern
  England, had been set to do it by the conditions of his birth.</p>

  <p>The other person whose previous history we have to ascertain is one,
  the tragedy of whose fate has blotted the remembrance of her
  sins&mdash;if her sins were, indeed, and in reality, more than imaginary.
  Forgetting all else in shame and sorrow, posterity has made piteous
  reparation for her death in the tenderness with which it has touched her
  reputation; and with the general instincts of justice, we have refused to
  qualify our indignation at the wrong which she experienced, by admitting
  either stain or shadow on her fame. It has been with Anne Boleyn as it
  has been with Catherine of Arragon&mdash;both are regarded as the victims
  of a tyranny which catholics and protestants unite to remember with
  horror; and each has taken the place of a martyred saint in the hagiology
  of the respective creeds. Catholic writers have, indeed, ill repaid, in
  their treatment of Anne, the admiration with which the mother of Queen
  Mary has been remembered in the Church of England; but the invectives
  which they have heaped upon her have defeated their object by their
  extravagance. It has been believed that matter failed them to sustain a
  just accusation, when they condescended to outrageous slander. Inasmuch,
  however, as some natural explanation can usually be given of the actions
  of human beings in this world without supposing them to have been
  possessed by extraordinary wickedness, and if we are to hold Anne Boleyn
  entirely free from fault, we place not the king only, but the privy
  council, the judges, the Lords and Commons, and the two Houses of
  Convocation, in a position fatal to their honour and degrading to
  ordinary humanity; we cannot without inquiry acquiesce in so painful a
  conclusion. The English nation also, as well as she, deserves justice at
  our hands; and it must not be thought uncharitable if we look with some
  scrutiny at the career of a person who, except for the catastrophe with
  which it was closed, would not so readily have obtained forgiveness for
  having admitted the addresses of the king, or for having received the
  homage of the court as its future sovereign, while the king's wife, her
  mistress, as yet resided under the same roof, with the title and the
  position of queen, and while the question was still undecided of the
  validity of the first marriage. If in that alone she was to blame, her
  fault was, indeed, revenged a thousandfold,&mdash;and yet no lady of true
  delicacy would have accepted such a position; and feeling for Queen
  Catherine should have restrained <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span> her, if she was
  careless of respect for herself. It must, therefore, be permitted me, out
  of such few hints and scattered notices as remain, to collect such
  information as may be trusted respecting her early life before her
  appearance upon the great stage. These hints are but slight, since I
  shall not even mention the scandals of Sanders, any more than I shall
  mention the panegyrics of Foxe; stories which, as far as I can learn,
  have no support in evidence, and rest on no stronger foundation than the
  credulity of passion.</p>

  <p>Anne Boleyn was the second daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, a gentleman
  of noble family, though moderate fortune;<a name="NtA_179"></a><a
  href="#Nt_179"><sup>179</sup></a> who, by a marriage with the daughter of
  the Duke of Norfolk, was brought into connection with the highest blood
  in the realm. The year of her birth has not been certainly ascertained,
  but she is supposed to have been seven years old<a name="NtA_180"></a><a
  href="#Nt_180"><sup>180</sup></a> in 1514, when she accompanied the
  Princess Mary into France, on the marriage of that lady with Louis XII.
  Louis dying a few months subsequently, the princess married Sir Charles
  Brandon, afterwards created Duke of Suffolk, and returned to England.
  Anne Boleyn did not return with her; she remained in Paris to become
  accomplished with the graces and elegancies, if she was not contaminated
  by the vices, of that court, which, even in those days of loyal
  licentiousness, enjoyed an undesirable pre-eminence in profligacy. In the
  French capital she could not have failed to see, to hear, and to become
  familiar with occurrences with which no young girl can be brought in
  contact with impunity, and this poisonous atmosphere she continued to
  breathe for nine years. She came back to England in 1525, to be maid of
  honour to Queen Catherine, and to be distinguished at the court, by
  general consent, for her talents, her accomplishments, and her beauty.
  Her portraits, though all professedly by Holbein, or copied from pictures
  by him, are singularly unlike each other. The profile in the picture
  which is best known is pretty, innocent, and piquant, though rather
  insignificant: there are other pictures, however, in which we see a face
  more powerful, though less prepossessing. In these the features are full
  and languid. The eyes are large; but the expression, though remarkable,
  is not pleasing, and indicates cunning more than thought, passion more
  than feeling; while the heavy lips and massive chin wear a <!-- Page 113
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> look of
  sensuality which is not to be mistaken. Possibly all are like the
  original, but represented her under different circumstances, or at
  different periods of her life. Previous to her engagement with the king,
  she was the object of fleeting attentions from the young noblemen about
  the court. Lord Percy, eldest son of Lord Northumberland, as we all know,
  was said to have been engaged to her. He was in the household of Cardinal
  Wolsey; and Cavendish, who was with him there, tells a long romantic
  story of the affair, which, if his account be true, was ultimately
  interrupted by Lord Northumberland himself. The story is not without its
  difficulties, since Lord Percy had been contracted, several years
  previously, to a daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury,<a
  name="NtA_181"></a><a href="#Nt_181"><sup>181</sup></a> whom he
  afterwards married, and by the law he could not have formed a second
  engagement so long as the first was undissolved. And again, he himself,
  when subsequently examined before the privy council, denied solemnly on
  his oath that any contract of the kind had existed.<a
  name="NtA_182"></a><a href="#Nt_182"><sup>182</sup></a> At the same time,
  we cannot suppose Cavendish to have invented so circumstantial a
  narrative, and Percy would not have been examined if there had been no
  reason for suspicion. Something, therefore, probably had passed between
  him and the young maid of honour, though we cannot now conjecture of what
  nature; and we can infer only that it was not openly to her discredit, or
  she would not have obtained the position which cost her so dear. She
  herself confessed subsequently, before Archbishop Cranmer, to a
  connection of some kind into which she had entered before her
  acquaintance with Henry. No evidence survives which will explain to what
  she referred, for the act of parliament which mentions the fact furnishes
  no details.<a name="NtA_183"></a><a href="#Nt_183"><sup>183</sup></a> But
  it was of a kind which made her marriage with the king illegal, and
  illegitimatised the offspring of it; and it has been supposed, therefore,
  that, in spite of Lord Percy's denial, he had really engaged himself to
  her, and was afraid to acknowledge it.<a name="NtA_184"></a><a
  href="#Nt_184"><sup>184</sup></a> This supposition, however, <!-- Page
  114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> is not
  easy to reconcile with the language of the act, which speaks of the
  circumstance, whatever it was, as only "recently known;" nor could a
  contract with Percy have invalidated her marriage with the king, when
  Percy having been pre-contracted to another person, it would have been
  itself invalid. A light is thrown upon the subject by a letter found
  among Cromwell's papers, addressed by some unknown person to a Mr.
  Melton, also unknown, but written obviously when "Mistress Anne" was a
  young lady about the court, and before she had been the object of any
  open attention from Henry.</p>

  <p>"MR. MELTON.&mdash;This shall be to advertise you that Mistress Anne
  is changed from that she was at when we three were last together.
  Wherefore I pray you that ye be no devil's sakke, but according to the
  truth ever justify, as ye shall make answer before God; and do not suffer
  her in my absence to be married to any other man. I must go to my master,
  wheresoever he be, for the Lord Privy Seal desireth much to speak with
  me, whom if I should speak with in my master's absence, it would cause me
  to lose my head; and yet I know myself as true a man to my prince as
  liveth, whom (as my friend informeth me) I have offended grievously in my
  words. No more to you, but to have me commended unto Mistress Anne, and
  bid her remember her promise, which none can loose, but God only, to whom
  I shall daily during my life commend her."<a name="NtA_185"></a><a
  href="#Nt_185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>

  <p>The letter must furnish its own interpretation; for it receives little
  from any other quarter. Being in the possession of Cromwell, however, it
  had perhaps been forwarded to him at the time of Queen Anne's trial, and
  may have thus occasioned the investigation which led to the annulling of
  her marriage.</p>

  <p>From the account which was written of her by the grandson of Sir
  Thomas Wyatt the poet, we still gather the impression (in spite of the
  admiring sympathy with which Wyatt writes) of a person with whom young
  men took liberties,<a name="NtA_186"></a><a
  href="#Nt_186"><sup>186</sup></a> however she might seem to forbid them.
  In her diet she was an epicure, fond of dainty and delicate eating, and
  not always contented if she did not obtain what she desired. When the
  king's attentions <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> towards her became first marked,
  Thomas Heneage, afterwards lord chamberlain, wrote to Wolsey, that he had
  one night been "commanded down with a dish for Mistress Anne for supper";
  adding that she caused him "to sup with her, and she wished she had some
  of Wolsey's good meat, as carps, shrimps, and others."<a
  name="NtA_187"></a><a href="#Nt_187"><sup>187</sup></a> And this was not
  said in jest, since Heneage related it as a hint to Wolsey, that he might
  know what to do, if he wished to please her. In the same letter he
  suggested to the cardinal that she was a little displeased at not having
  received a token or present from him; she was afraid she was forgotten,
  he said, and "the lady, her mother, desired him to send unto his Grace,
  and desire his Grace to bestow a morsel of tunny upon her." Wolsey made
  her presents also at times of a more valuable character, as we find her
  acknowledging in language of exaggerated gratitude;<a
  name="NtA_188"></a><a href="#Nt_188"><sup>188</sup></a> and, perhaps the
  most painful feature in all her earlier history lies in the contrast
  between the servility with which she addressed the cardinal so long as he
  was in power, and the bitterness with which the Bishop of Bayonne (and,
  in fact, all contemporary witnesses) tells us, that she pressed upon his
  decline. Wolsey himself spoke of her under the title of "the
  night-crow,"<a name="NtA_189"></a><a href="#Nt_189"><sup>189</sup></a> as
  the person to whom he owed all which was most cruel in his treatment; as
  "the enemy that never slept, but studied and continually imagined, both
  sleeping and waking, his utter destruction."<a name="NtA_190"></a><a
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>

  <p>Taking these things together, and there is nothing to be placed beside
  them of a definitely pleasing kind, except beauty and accomplishments, we
  form, with the assistance of her pictures, a tolerable conception of this
  lady; a conception of her as a woman not indeed questionable, but as one
  whose antecedents might lead consistently to a future either of evil or
  of good; and whose character removes the surprise which we might be
  inclined to feel at the position with respect to Queen Catherine in which
  she consented to be placed. A harsh critic would describe her, on this
  evidence, as a self-indulgent coquette, indifferent to the <!-- Page 116
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
  obligations of gratitude, and something careless of the truth. From the
  letter referring to her, preserved by Cromwell, it appears that she had
  broken a definite promise at a time when such promises were legally
  binding, and that she had really done so was confirmed by her subsequent
  confession. The breach of such promises by a woman who could not be
  expected to understand the grounds on which the law held them to be
  sacred, implies no more than levity, and levity of this kind has been
  found compatible with many high qualities. Levity, however, it does
  undoubtedly imply, and the symptom, if a light one, must be allowed the
  weight which is due to it.</p>

  <p>It is a miserable duty to be compelled to search for these indications
  of human infirmities; above all when they are the infirmities of a lady
  whose faults, let them have been what they would, were so fearfully and
  terribly expiated; and, if there were nothing else at issue but poor
  questions of petty scandal, it were better far that they perished in
  forgetfulness, and passed away out of mind and memory for ever. The
  fortunes of Anne Boleyn were unhappily linked with those of men to whom
  the greatest work ever yet accomplished in this country was committed;
  and the characters of a king of England, and of the three estates of the
  realm, are compromised in the treatment which she received from them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE PARLIAMENT OF 1529</h3>

  <p>No Englishman can look back uninterested on the meeting of the
  parliament of 1529. The era at which it assembled is the most memorable
  in the history of this country, and the work which it accomplished before
  its dissolution was of larger moment politically and spiritually than the
  achievements of the Long Parliament itself. For nearly seven years it
  continued surrounded by intrigue, confusion, and at length conspiracy,
  presiding over a people from whom the forms and habits by which they had
  moved for centuries were falling like the shell of a chrysalis. While
  beset with enemies within the realm and without, it effected a revolution
  which severed England from the papacy, yet it preserved peace unbroken
  and prevented anarchy from <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> breaking bounds; and although its
  hands are not pure from spot, and red stains rest on them which posterity
  have bitterly and long remembered; yet if we consider the changes which
  it carried through, and if we think of the price which was paid by other
  nations for victory in the same struggle, we shall acknowledge that the
  records of the world contain no instance of such a triumph, bought at a
  cost so slight and tarnished by blemishes so trifling.</p>

  <p>The letters of the French Ambassador<a name="NtA_191"></a><a
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>191</sup></a> describe to us the gathering of the
  members into London, and the hum of expectation sounding louder and
  louder as the day of the opening approached. In order that we may see
  distinctly what London felt on this occasion, that we may understand in
  detail the nature of those questions with which parliament was
  immediately to deal, we will glance at some of the proceedings which had
  taken place in the Bishops' Consistory Courts during the few preceding
  years. The duties of the officials of these courts resembled in theory
  the duties of the censors under the Roman Republic. In the middle ages, a
  lofty effort had been made to overpass the common limitations of
  government, to introduce punishment for sins as well as crimes, and to
  visit with temporal penalties the breach of the moral law. The punishment
  best adapted for such offences was some outward expression of the
  disapproval with which good men regard acts of sin; some open disgrace;
  some spiritual censure; some suspension of communion with the church,
  accompanied by other consequences practically inconvenient, to be
  continued until the offender had made reparation, or had openly repented,
  or had given confirmed proof of amendment. The administration of such a
  discipline fell, as a matter of course, to the clergy. The clergy were
  the guardians of morality; their characters were a claim to confidence,
  their duties gave them opportunities of observation which no other men
  could possess; while their priestly office gave solemn weight to their
  sentences. Thus arose throughout Europe a system of spiritual
  surveillance over the habits and conduct of every man, extending from the
  cottage to the castle, taking note of all wrong dealing, of all
  oppression of man by man, of all licentiousness and profligacy, and
  representing upon earth, in the principles by which it was guided, the
  laws of the great tribunal of Almighty God.</p>

  <p>Such was the origin of the church courts, perhaps the greatest
  institutions ever yet devised by man. But to aim at these high ideals is
  as perilous as it is noble; and weapons which may be <!-- Page 118
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> safely
  trusted in the hands of saints become fatal implements of mischief when
  saints have ceased to wield them. For a time, we need not doubt, the
  practice corresponded to the intention. Had it not been so, the
  conception would have taken no root, and would have been extinguished at
  its birth. But a system which has once established itself in the respect
  of mankind will be tolerated long after it has forfeited its claim to
  endurance, as the name of a great man remains honoured though borne by
  worthless descendants; and the Consistory courts had continued into the
  sixteenth century with unrestricted jurisdiction, although they had been
  for generations merely perennially flowing fountains, feeding the
  ecclesiastical exchequer. The moral conduct of every English man and
  woman remained subject to them. Each private person was liable to be
  called in question for every action of his life; and an elaborate network
  of canon law perpetually growing, enveloped the whole surface of society.
  But between the original design and the degenerate counterfeit there was
  this vital difference,&mdash;that the censures were no longer spiritual.
  They were commuted in various gradations for pecuniary fines, and each
  offence against morality was rated at its specific money value in the
  episcopal tables. Suspension and excommunication remained as ultimate
  penalties; but they were resorted to only to compel unwilling culprits to
  accept the alternative.</p>

  <p>The misdemeanours of which the courts took cognisance<a
  name="NtA_192"></a><a href="#Nt_192"><sup>192</sup></a> were "offences
  against chastity," "heresy," or "matter sounding thereunto,"
  "witchcraft," "drunkenness," "scandal," "defamation," "impatient words,"
  "broken promises," "untruth," "absence from church," "speaking evil of
  saints," "non-payment of offerings," and other delinquencies incapable of
  legal definition; matters, all of them, on which it was well, if
  possible, to keep men from going wrong; but offering wide opportunities
  for injustice; while all charges, whether well founded or ill, met with
  ready acceptance in courts where innocence and guilt alike contributed to
  the revenue.<a name="NtA_193"></a><a href="#Nt_193"><sup>193</sup></a>
  "Mortuary claims" were another fertile matter for prosecution; and
  probate duties and legacy duties; and a further lucrative occupation was
  the punishment of persons who complained against the constitutions of the
  courts themselves; to complain against the justice of the courts being to
  complain against the church, and to complain <!-- Page 119 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> against the church
  being heresy. To answer accusations on such subjects as these, men were
  liable to be summoned, at the will of the officials, to the metropolitan
  courts of the archbishops, hundreds of miles from their homes.<a
  name="NtA_194"></a><a href="#Nt_194"><sup>194</sup></a> No expenses were
  allowed; and if the charges were without foundation, it was rare that
  costs could be recovered. Innocent or guilty, the accused parties were
  equally bound to appear.<a name="NtA_195"></a><a
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>195</sup></a> If they failed, they were suspended for
  contempt. If after receiving notice of their suspension, they did not
  appear, they were excommunicated; and no proof of the groundlessness of
  the original charge availed to relieve them from their sentence, till
  they had paid for their deliverance.</p>

  <p>Well did the church lawyers understand how to make their work
  productive. Excommunication seems but a light thing when there are many
  communions. It was no light thing when it was equivalent to outlawry;
  when the person excommunicated might be seized and imprisoned at the will
  of the ordinary; when he was cut off from all holy offices; when no one
  might speak to him, trade with him, or show him the most trivial
  courtesy; and when his friends, if they dared to assist him, were subject
  to the same penalties. In the <i>Register</i> of the Bishop of London<a
  name="NtA_196"></a><a href="#Nt_196"><sup>196</sup></a> there is more
  than one instance to be found of suspension and excommunication for the
  simple crime of offering shelter to an excommunicated neighbour; and thus
  offence begot offence, guilt spread like a contagion through the
  influence of natural humanity, and a single refusal of obedience to a
  frivolous citation might involve entire families in misery and ruin.</p>

  <p>The people might have endured better to submit to so enormous a
  tyranny, if the conduct of the clergy themselves had given them a title
  to respect, or if equal justice had been distributed to lay and spiritual
  offenders. "Benefit of clergy," unhappily, as at this time interpreted,
  was little else than a privilege to commit sins with impunity. The
  grossest moral profligacy in a priest was passed over with indifference;
  and so far from exacting obedience in her ministers to a higher standard
  than she required of ordinary persons, the church extended her limits
  under fictitious pretexts as a sanctuary for lettered villany. Every
  person who could read was claimed by prescriptive usage as a clerk, and
  shielded under her protecting mantle; nor was <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> any clerk amenable
  for the worst crimes to the secular jurisdiction, until he had been first
  tried and degraded by the ecclesiastical judges. So far was this
  preposterous exemption carried, that previous to the passing of the first
  of the 23rd of Henry the Eighth,<a name="NtA_197"></a><a
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>197</sup></a> those who were within the degrees might
  commit murder with impunity, the forms which it was necessary to observe
  in degrading a priest or deacon being so complicated as to amount to
  absolute protection.<a name="NtA_198"></a><a
  href="#Nt_198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>

  <p>Among the clergy, properly so called, however, the prevailing offence
  was not crime, but licentiousness. A doubt has recently crept in among
  our historians as to the credibility of the extreme language in which the
  contemporary writers spoke upon this painful topic. It will scarcely be
  supposed that the picture has been overdrawn in the act books of the
  Consistory courts; and as we see it there it is almost too deplorable for
  belief, as well in its own intrinsic hideousness as in the unconscious
  connivance of the authorities. Brothels were kept in London for the
  especial use of priests;<a name="NtA_199"></a><a
  href="#Nt_199"><sup>199</sup></a> the "confessional" was abused in the
  most open and abominable manner.<a name="NtA_200"></a><a
  href="#Nt_200"><sup>200</sup></a> Cases occurred of <!-- Page 121
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> the same
  frightful profanity in the service of the mass, which at Rome startled
  Luther into Protestantism;<a name="NtA_201"></a><a
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>201</sup></a> and acts of incest between nuns and
  monks were too frequently exposed to allow us to regard the detected
  instances as exceptions.<a name="NtA_202"></a><a
  href="#Nt_202"><sup>202</sup></a> It may be said that the proceedings
  upon these charges prove at least that efforts were made to repress them.
  The bishops must have the benefit of the plea, and the two following
  instances will show how far it will avail their cause. In the Records of
  the London Court I find a certain Thomas Wyseman, priest, summoned for
  fornication and incontinency. He was enjoined for penance, that on the
  succeeding Sunday, while high mass was singing, he should offer at each
  of the altars in the Church of St. Bartholomew a candle of wax, value one
  penny, saying therewith five <i>Paternosters</i>, five <i>Ave Marys</i>,
  and five <i>Credos</i>. On the following Friday he was to offer a candle
  of the same price before the crucifix, standing barefooted, and one
  before the image of cur Lady of Grace. This penance accomplished he
  appeared again at the court and compounded for absolution, paying six
  shillings and eightpence.<a name="NtA_203"></a><a
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>

  <p>An exposure too common to attract notice, and a fine of six and
  eightpence was held sufficient penalty for a mortal sin.</p>

  <p>Even this, however, was a severe sentence compared with the sentence
  passed upon another priest who confessed to <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> incest with the
  prioress of Kilbourn. The offender was condemned to bear a cross in a
  procession in his parish church, and was excused his remaining guilt for
  three shillings and fourpence.<a name="NtA_204"></a><a
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>

  <p>I might multiply such instances indefinitely; but there is no occasion
  for me to stain my pages with them.<a name="NtA_205"></a><a
  href="#Nt_205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>

  <p>An inactive imagination may readily picture to itself the indignation
  likely to have been felt by a high-minded people, when they were forced
  to submit their lives, their habits, their most intimate conversations
  and opinions to a censorship conducted by clergy of such a character;
  when the offences of these clergy themselves were passed over with such
  indifferent carelessness. Men began to ask themselves who and what these
  persons were who retained the privileges of saints,<a
  name="NtA_206"></a><a href="#Nt_206"><sup>206</sup></a> and were
  incapable of <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> the most ordinary duties; and for many
  years before the burst of the Reformation the coming storm was gathering.
  Priests were hooted, or "knocked down into the kennel,"<a
  name="NtA_207"></a><a href="#Nt_207"><sup>207</sup></a> as they walked
  along the streets&mdash;women refused to receive the holy bread from
  hands which they thought polluted,<a name="NtA_208"></a><a
  href="#Nt_208"><sup>208</sup></a> and the appearance of an apparitor of
  the courts to serve a process or a citation in a private house was a
  signal for instant explosion. Violent words were the least which these
  officials had to fear, and they were fortunate if they escaped so
  lightly. A stranger had died in a house in St. Dunstan's belonging to a
  certain John Fleming, and an apparitor had been sent "to seal his chamber
  and his goods" that the church might not lose her dues. John Fleming
  drove him out, saying loudly unto him, "Thou shalt seale no door here; go
  thy way, thou stynkyng knave, ye are but knaves and brybours everych one
  of you."<a name="NtA_209"></a><a href="#Nt_209"><sup>209</sup></a> Thomas
  Banister, of St. Mary Wolechurch, when a process was served upon him,
  "did threaten to slay the apparitor." "Thou horson knave," he said to
  him, "without thou tell me who set <!-- Page 124 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> thee awork to
  summon me to the court, by Goddis woundes, and by this gold, I shall
  brake thy head."<a name="NtA_210"></a><a
  href="#Nt_210"><sup>210</sup></a> A "waiter, at the sign of the Cock,"
  fell in trouble for saying that "the sight of a priest did make him
  sick," also, "that he would go sixty miles to indict a priest," saying
  also in the presence of many&mdash;"horsyn priests, they shall be
  indicted as many as come to my handling."<a name="NtA_211"></a><a
  href="#Nt_211"><sup>211</sup></a> Often the officers found threats
  convert themselves into acts. The apparitor of the Bishop of London went
  with a citation into the shop of a mercer of St. Bride's, Henry Clitheroe
  by name. "Who does cite me?" asked the mercer. "Marry, that do I,"
  answered the apparitor, "if thou wilt anything with it;" whereupon, as
  the apparitor deposeth, the said Henry Clitheroe did hurl at him from off
  his finger that instrument of his art called the "thymmelle," and he, the
  apparitor, drawing his sword, "the said Henry did snatch up his virga,
  Anglice, his yard, and did pursue the apparitor into the public streets,
  and after multiplying of many blows did break the head of the said
  apparitor."<a name="NtA_212"></a><a href="#Nt_212"><sup>212</sup></a>
  These are light matters, but they were straws upon the stream; and such a
  scene as this which follows reveals the principles on which the courts
  awarded their judgment. One Richard Hunt was summoned for certain
  articles implying contempt, and for vilipending his lordship's
  jurisdiction. Being examined, he confessed to the words following: "That
  all false matters were bolstered and clokyd in this court of Paul's
  Cheyne; moreover he called the apparitor, William Middleton, false knave
  in the full court, and his father's dettes, said he, by means of his
  mother-in-law and master commissary, were not payd; and this he would
  abide by, that he had now in this place said no more but truth." Being
  called on to answer further, he said he would not, and his lordship did
  therefore excommunicate him.<a name="NtA_213"></a><a
  href="#Nt_213"><sup>213</sup></a> From so brief an entry we cannot tell
  on which side the justice lay; but at least we can measure the equity of
  a tribunal which punished complaints against itself with excommunication,
  and dismissed the confessed incest of a priest with a fine of a few
  shillings.</p>

  <p>Such then were the English consistory courts. I have selected but a
  few instances from the proceedings of a single one of them. If we are to
  understand the weight with which the system pressed upon the people, we
  must multiply the proceedings at St. Paul's by the number of the English
  dioceses; the number of dioceses by the number of archdeaconries; we <!--
  Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>
  must remember that in proportion to the distance from London the abuse
  must have increased indefinitely from the absence of even partial
  surveillance; we must remember that appeals were permitted only from one
  ecclesiastical court to another; from the archdeacon's court to that of
  the bishop of the diocese, from that of the bishop to the Court of
  Arches; that any language of impatience or resistance furnished suspicion
  of heresy, and that the only security therefore was submission. We can
  then imagine what England must have been with an archdeacon's commissary
  sitting constantly in every town; exercising an undefined jurisdiction
  over general morality; and every court swarming with petty lawyers who
  lived upon the fees which they could extract. Such a system for the
  administration of justice was perhaps never tolerated before in any
  country.</p>

  <p>But the time of reckoning at length was arrived; slowly the hand had
  crawled along the dial plate; slowly as if the event would never come:
  and wrong was heaped on wrong; and oppression cried, and it seemed as if
  no ear had heard its voice; till the measure of the circle was at length
  fulfilled, the finger touched the hour, and as the strokes of the great
  hammer rang out above the nation, in an instant the mighty fabric of
  iniquity was shivered into ruins. Wolsey had dreamed that it might still
  stand, self-reformed as he hoped to see it; but in his dread lest any
  hands but those of friends should touch the work, he had "prolonged its
  sickly days," waiting for the convenient season which was not to be; he
  had put off the meeting of parliament, knowing that if parliament were
  once assembled, he would be unable to resist the pressure which would be
  brought to bear upon him; and in the impatient minds of the people he had
  identified himself with the evils which he alone for the few last years
  had hindered from falling. At length he had fallen himself, and his
  disgrace was celebrated in London with enthusiastic rejoicing as the
  inauguration of the new era. On the eighteenth of October, 1529, Wolsey
  delivered up the seals. He was ordered to retire to Esher; and, "at the
  taking of his barge," Cavendish saw no less than a thousand boats full of
  men and women of the city of London, "waffeting up and down in Thames,"
  to see him sent, as they expected, to the Tower.<a name="NtA_214"></a><a
  href="#Nt_214"><sup>214</sup></a> A fortnight later the same crowd was
  perhaps again assembled on a wiser occasion, and with truer reason for
  exultation, to see the king coming up in his barge from Greenwich to open
  parliament.</p>

<!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>

  <p>"According to the summons," says Hall, "the King of England began his
  high court of parliament the third day of November, on which day he came
  by water to his palace of Bridewell, and there he and his nobles put on
  their robes of Parliament, and so came to the Black Friars Church, where
  a mass of the Holy Ghost was solemnly sung by the king's chaplain; and
  after the mass, the king, with all his Lords and Commons which were
  summoned to appear on that day, came into the Parliament. The king sate
  on his throne or seat royal, and Sir Thomas More, his chancellor,
  standing on the right hand of the king, made an eloquent oration, setting
  forth the causes why at that time the king so had summoned them."<a
  name="NtA_215"></a><a href="#Nt_215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Like as a good shepherd," More said, "which not only keepeth and
  attendeth well his sheep, but also foreseeth and provideth for all things
  which either may be hurtful or noysome to his flock; so the king, which
  is the shepherd, ruler, and governor of his realm, vigilantly foreseeing
  things to come, considers how that divers laws, before this time made,
  are now, by long continuance of time and mutation of things, become very
  insufficient and imperfect; and also, by the frail condition of man,
  divers new enormities are sprung amongst the people, for the which no law
  is yet made to reform the same. For this cause the king at this time has
  summoned his high court of parliament; and I liken the king to a shepherd
  or herdsman, because if a prince be compared to his riches, he is but a
  rich man; if a prince be compared to his honour, he is but an honourable
  man; but compare him to the multitude of his people, and the number of
  his flock, then he is a ruler, a governor of might and puissance; so that
  his people maketh him a prince, as of the multitude of sheep cometh the
  name of a shepherd.</p>

  <p>"And as you see that amongst a great flock of sheep some be rotten and
  faulty, which the good shepherd sendeth from the good sheep; so the great
  wether which is of late fallen, as you all know, so craftily, so
  scabedly, yea, so untruly juggled with the king, that all men must needs
  guess that he thought in himself, either the king had no wit to perceive
  his crafty doings, or else that he would not see nor know them.</p>

  <p>"But he was deceived, for his Grace's sight was so quick and
  penetrable that he saw him; yea, and saw through him, both within and
  without; and according to his desert he hath had a gentle correction,
  which small punishment the king will not to be an example to other
  offenders; but clearly declareth <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> that whosoever
  hereafter shall make like attempt, or shall commit like offence, shall
  not escape with like punishment.</p>

  <p>"And because you of the Commons House be a gross multitude, and cannot
  all speak at one time, the king's pleasure is, that you resort to the
  Nether House, and then amongst yourselves, according to the old and
  antient custom, choose an able person to be your common mouth and
  speaker."<a name="NtA_216"></a><a href="#Nt_216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>

  <p>The invective against "the great wether" was not perhaps the portion
  of the speech to which the audience listened with least interest. In the
  minds of contemporaries, principles are identified with persons, who
  form, as it were, the focus on which the passions concentrate. At present
  we may consent to forget Wolsey, and fix our attention on the more
  permanently essential matter&mdash;the reform of the laws. The world was
  changing; how swiftly, how completely, no living person knew;&mdash;but a
  confusion no longer tolerable was a patent fact to all men; and with a
  wise instinct it was resolved that the grievances of the nation, which
  had accumulated through centuries, should be submitted to a complete
  ventilation, without reserve, check, or secrecy.</p>

  <p>For this purpose it was essential that the Houses should not be
  interfered with, that they should be allowed full liberty to express
  their wishes and to act upon them. Accordingly, the practice then usual
  with ministers, of undertaking the direction of the proceedings, was
  clearly on this occasion foregone. In the House of Commons then, as much
  as now, there was in theory unrestricted liberty of discussion, and free
  right for any member to originate whatever motion he pleased. "The
  discussions in the English Parliament," wrote Henry himself to the pope,
  "are free and unrestricted; the crown has no power to limit their debates
  or to controul the votes of the members. They determine everything for
  themselves, as the interests of the commonwealth require."<a
  name="NtA_217"></a><a href="#Nt_217"><sup>217</sup></a> But so long as
  confidence existed between the crown and the people, these rights were in
  great measure surrendered. The ministers prepared the business which was
  to be transacted; and the temper of the Houses was usually so well
  understood, that, except when there was a demand for money, it was rare
  that a measure was proposed the acceptance of which was doubtful, or the
  nature of which would provoke debate. So little jealousy, indeed, was in
  quiet times entertained of the power of the crown, and so little was a
  residence in London to the taste of the burgesses and the <!-- Page 128
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> country
  gentlemen, that not only were their expenses defrayed by a considerable
  salary, but it was found necessary to forbid them absenting themselves
  from their duties by a positive enactment.<a name="NtA_218"></a><a
  href="#Nt_218"><sup>218</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the composition of the House of Commons, however, which had now
  assembled, no symptoms appeared of such indifference. The election had
  taken place in the midst of great and general excitement; and the members
  chosen, if we may judge from their acts and their petitions, were men of
  that broad resolved temper, who only in times of popular effervescence
  are called forward into prominence. It would have probably been unsafe
  for the crown to attempt dictation or repression at such a time, if it
  had desired to do so. Under the actual circumstances, its interest was to
  encourage the fullest expression of public feeling.</p>

  <p>The proceedings were commenced with a formal "act of accusation"
  against the clergy, which was submitted to the king in the name of the
  Commons of England, and contained a summary of the wrongs of which the
  people complained. This remarkable document must have been drawn up
  before the opening of parliament, and must have been presented in the
  first week of the session,&mdash;probably on the first day on which the
  House met to transact business.<a name="NtA_219"></a><a
  href="#Nt_219"><sup>219</sup></a> There is appearance of haste in the
  composition, little order being observed in the catalogue of grievances;
  but inasmuch as it contains the germ of all the acts which were framed in
  the following years for the reform of the church, and is in fact the most
  complete exhibition which we possess of the working of the church system
  at the time when it ceased to be any more tolerable, I have thought it
  well to insert it uncurtailed. Although the fact of the presentation of
  this petition has been well known, it has not been accurately described
  by any of our historians, none of them appearing to have seen more than
  incorrect and imperfect epitomes of it.<a name="NtA_220"></a><a

  well through new fantastical and erroneous opinions grown by occasion of
  frantic seditious books compiled, imprinted, published, and made in the
  English tongue, contrary and against the very true Catholic and Christian
  faith; as also by the extreme and uncharitable behaviour and dealing of
  divers ordinaries, their commissaries and sumners, which have heretofore
  had, and yet have the examination in and upon the said errours and
  heretical opinions; much discord, variance, and debate hath risen, and
  more and more daily is like to increase and ensue amongst the universal
  sort of your said subjects, as well spiritual as temporal, each against
  the other&mdash;in most uncharitable manner, to the great inquietation,
  vexation, and breach of your peace within this your most Catholic
  Realm:</p>

  <p>"The special particular griefs whereof, which most principally concern
  your Commons and lay subjects, and which are, as they undoubtedly
  suppose, the very chief fountains, occasions, and causes that daily
  breedeth and nourisheth the said seditious factions, deadly hatred, and
  most uncharitable part taking, of either part of said subjects spiritual
  and temporal against the other, followingly do ensue.&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I. First the prelates and spiritual ordinaries of this your most
  excellent Realm of England, and the clergy of the same, have in their
  convocations heretofore made or caused to be made, and also daily do make
  many and divers fashions of laws, constitutions, and ordinances; without
  your knowledge or most Royal assent, and without the assent and consent
  of any of your lay subjects; unto the which laws your said lay subjects
  have not only heretofore been and daily be constrained to obey, in their
  bodies, goods, and possessions; but have also been compelled to incur
  daily into the censures of the same, and been continually put to
  importable charges and expenses, against all equity, right, and good
  conscience. And yet your said humble subjects ne their predecessors could
  ever be privy to the said laws; ne any of the said laws have been
  declared unto them in the English tongue, or otherwise published, by
  knowledge whereof they might have eschewed the penalties, dangers, or
  censures of the same; which laws so made your said most humble and
  obedient servants, under the supportation of your Majesty, suppose to be
  not only to the diminution and derogation of your imperial jurisdiction
  and prerogative royal, but also to the great prejudice, inquietation, and
  damage of your said subjects.</p>

  <p>"II. Also now of late there hath been devised by the Most Reverend
  Father in God, William, Archbishop of Canterbury, that in the courts
  which he calleth his Courts of the Arches and Audience, shall only be ten
  proctors at his deputation, which be sworn to preserve and promote the
  only jurisdiction of his said courts; by reason whereof, if any of your
  lay subjects should have any lawful cause against the judges of the said
  courts, or any doctors or proctors of the same, or any of their friends
  and adherents, they can ne may in nowise have indifferent counsel: and
  also all the causes depending in any of the said courts may by the
  confederacy of the said few proctors be in such wise tracted and delayed,
  as your subjects suing in the same shall be put to importable charges,
  costs, and expense. And further, in case that any matter there being
  preferred should touch your crown, your regal jurisdiction, and
  prerogative Royal, yet the same shall not be disclosed by any of the said
  proctors for fear of the loss of their offices. Your most obedient
  subjects do therefore, under protection of your Majesty, suppose that
  your Highness should have the nomination of some convenient number of
  proctors to be always attendant upon the said Courts of Arches and
  Audience, there to be sworn to the preferment of your jurisdiction and
  prerogative, and to the expedition of the causes of your lay subjects
  repairing and suing to the same.</p>

  <p>"III. And also many of your said most humble and obedient subjects, and
  <i>specially those that be of the poorest sort</i>, within this your
  Realm, be daily convented and called before the said spiritual
  ordinaries, their commissaries and substitutes, <i>ex officio</i>;
  sometimes, at the pleasure of the said ordinaries, for malice without any
  cause; and sometimes at the only promotion and accusement of their
  summoners and apparitors, being light and undiscreet persons; without any
  lawful cause of accusation, or credible fame proved against them, and
  without any presentment in the visitation: and your said poor subjects be
  thus inquieted, disturbed, vexed, troubled, and put to excessive and
  importable charges for them to bear&mdash;and many times be suspended and
  excommunicate for small and light causes upon the only certificate of the
  proctors of the adversaries, made under a feigned seal which every
  proctor hath in his keeping; whereas the party suspended or excommunicate
  many times never had any warning; and yet when he shall be absolved, if
  it be out of court, he shall be compelled to pay <!-- Page 131 --><span

  twenty<a name="NtA_221"></a><a href="#Nt_221"><sup>221</sup></a>
  <i>pence</i>; to the proctor which is against him other twenty pence, and
  twenty pence to the scribe, besides a privy reward that the judge shall
  have, to the great impoverishing of your said poor lay subjects.</p>

  <p>"IV. Also your said most humble and obedient servants find themselves
  grieved with the great and excessive fees taken in the said spiritual
  courts, and especially in the said Courts of the Arches and Audience;
  where they take for every citation two shillings and sixpence; for every
  inhibition six shillings and eightpence; for every proxy sixteen pence;
  for every certificate sixteen pence; for every libel three shillings and
  fourpence; for every answer for every libel three shillings and
  fourpence; for every act, if it be but two words according to the
  register, fourpence; for every personal citation or decree three
  shillings and fourpence; for every sentence or judgment, to the judge
  twenty-six shillings and eightpence; for every testament upon such
  sentence or judgment twenty-six shillings and eightpence; for every
  significavit twelve shillings; for every commission to examine witnesses
  twelve shillings, which charges be thought importable to be borne by your
  said subjects, and very necessary to be reformed.</p>

  <p>"V. And also the said prelates and ordinaries daily do permit and
  suffer the parsons, vicars, curates, parish priests, and other spiritual
  persons having cure of souls within this your Realm, to exact and take of
  your humble servants divers sums of money for the sacraments and
  sacramentals of Holy Church, sometimes denying the same without they be
  first paid<a name="NtA_222"></a><a href="#Nt_222"><sup>222</sup></a> the
  said sums of money, which sacraments and sacramentals your said most
  humble and obedient subjects, under protection of your Highness, do
  suppose and think ought to be in most reverend, charitable, and godly
  wise freely ministered unto them at all times requisite, without denial,
  or exaction of any manner sums of money to be demanded or asked for the
  same.</p>

  <p>"VI. And also in the spiritual courts of the said prelates and
  ordinaries there be limited and appointed so many judges, scribes,
  apparitors, summoners, appraysers, and other ministers for the
  approbation of Testaments, which covet so much their <!-- Page 132
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> own
  private lucres, and the satisfaction and appetites of the said prelates
  and ordinaries, that when any of your said loving subjects do repair to
  any of the said courts for the probate of any Testaments, they do in such
  wise make so long delays, or excessively do take of them so large fees
  and rewards for the same as is importable for them to bear, directly
  against all justice, law, equity, and good conscience. Therefore your
  most humble and obedient subjects do, under your gracious correction and
  supportation, suppose it were very necessary that the said ordinaries in
  their deputation of judges should be bound to appoint and assign such
  discreet, gracious, and honest persons, having sufficient learning, wit,
  discretion, and understanding; and also being endowed with such spiritual
  promotion, stipend, and salary; as they being judges in their said courts
  might and may minister to every person repairing to the same,
  justice&mdash;without taking any manner of fee or reward for any manner
  of sentence or judgment to be given before them.</p>

  <p>"VII. And also divers spiritual persons being presented as well by your
  Highness as others within this your Realm to divers benefices or other
  spiritual promotions, the said ordinaries and their ministers do not only
  take of them for their letters of institution and induction many large
  sums of money and rewards; but also do pact and covenant with the same,
  taking sure bonds for their indemnity to answer to the said ordinaries
  for the firstfruits of their said benefices after their
  institution&mdash;so as they, being once presented or promoted, as
  aforesaid, are by the said ordinaries very uncharitably handled, to their
  no little hindrance and impoverishment; which your said subjects suppose
  not only to be against all laws, right, and good conscience, but also to
  be simony, and contrary to the laws of God.</p>

  <p>"VIII. And also <i>the said spiritual ordinaries do daily confer and
  give sundry benefices unto certain young folks, calling them their
  nephews or kinsfolk</i>, being in their minority and within age, not apt
  ne able to serve the cure of any such benefice: whereby the said
  ordinaries do keep and detain the fruits and profits of the same
  benefices in their own hands, and thereby accumulate to themselves right
  great and large sums of money and yearly profits, to the most pernicious
  example of your said lay subjects&mdash;and so the cures and promotions
  given unto such infants be only employed to the enriching of the said
  ordinaries; and the poor silly souls of your people, which should be
  taught in the parishes given as aforesaid, for lack of good curates [be
  left] to perish without doctrine or any good teaching.</p>

<!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>

  <p>"IX. Also, a great number of holydays now at this present time, with
  very small devotion, be solemnised and kept throughout this your Realm,
  upon the which many great, abominable, and execrable vices, idle and
  wanton sports, be used and exercised, which holydays, if it may stand
  with your Grace's pleasure, and specially such as fall in the harvest,
  might, by your Majesty, with the advice of your most honourable council,
  prelates, and ordinaries, be made fewer in number; and those that shall
  be hereafter ordained to stand and continue, might and may be the more
  devoutly, religiously, and reverendly observed, to the laud of Almighty
  God, and to the increase of your high honour and favour.</p>

  <p>"X. And furthermore the said spiritual ordinaries, their commissaries
  and substitutes, sometimes for their own pleasure, sometimes by the
  sinister procurement of other spiritual persons, use to make out process
  against divers of your said subjects, and thereby compel them to appear
  before themselves, to answer at a certain day and place to such articles
  as by them shall be, <i>ex officio</i>, then proposed; and that secretly
  and not in open places;<a name="NtA_223"></a><a
  href="#Nt_223"><sup>223</sup></a> and forthwith upon their appearance,
  without any declaration made or showed, commit and send them to ward,
  sometimes for [half] a year, sometimes for a whole year or more, before
  they may in anywise know either the cause of their imprisonment or the
  name of their accuser;<a name="NtA_224"></a><a
  href="#Nt_224"><sup>224</sup></a> and finally after their great costs and
  charges therein, when all is examined and nothing can be proved against
  them, but they clearly innocent for any fault or crime that can be laid
  unto them, they be again set at large without any recompence or amends in
  that behalf to be towards them adjudged.</p>

  <p>"XI. And also if percase upon the said process and appearance any party
  be upon the said matter, cause, or examination, brought forth and named,
  either as party or witness, and then upon the proof and trial thereof be
  not able to prove and verify the said accusation and testimony against
  the party accused, then the person so accused is for the more part
  without any remedy for his charges and wrongful vexation to be towards
  him adjudged and recovered.</p>

<!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>

  <p>"XII. Also upon the examination of the said accusation, if heresy be
  ordinarily laid unto the charge of the parties so accused, then the said
  ordinaries or their ministers use to put to them such subtle
  interrogatories concerning the high mysteries of our faith, as are able
  quickly to trap a simple unlearned, or yet a well-witted layman without
  learning, and bring them by such sinister introductions soon to their own
  confusion. And further, if there chance any heresy to be by such subtle
  policy, by any person confessed in words, and yet never committed neither
  in thought nor deed, then put they, without further favour, the said
  person either to make his purgation, and so thereby to lose his honesty
  and credence for ever; or else as some simple silly soul [may do], the
  said person may stand precisely to the testimony of his own well-known
  conscience, rather than confess his innocent truth in that behalf [to be
  other than he knows it to be], and so be utterly destroyed. And if it
  fortune the said party so accused to deny the said accusation, and to put
  his adversaries to prove the same as being untrue, forged and imagined
  against him, then for the most part such witnesses as are brought forth
  for the same, be they but two in number, never so sore diffamed, of
  little truth or credence, they shall be allowed and enabled, only by
  discretion of the said ordinaries, their commissaries or substitutes; and
  thereupon sufficient cause be found to proceed to judgment, to deliver
  the party so accused either to secular hands, after abjuration,<a
  name="NtA_225"></a><a href="#Nt_225"><sup>225</sup></a> without remedy;
  or afore if he submit himself, as best happeneth, he shall have to make
  his purgation and bear a faggot, to his extreme shame and undoing.</p>

  <p>"In consideration of all these things, most gracious Sovereign Lord,
  and forasmuch as there is at this present time, and by a few years past
  hath been outrageous violence on the one part and much default and lack
  of patient sufferance, charity, and good will on the other part; and
  consequently a marvellous disorder [hath ensued] of the godly quiet,
  peace, and tranquillity in which this your Realm heretofore, ever
  hitherto, has been through your politic wisdom, most honourable fame, and
  catholic faith inviolably preserved; it may therefore, most benign
  Sovereign Lord, like your excellent goodness for the tender and
  universally indifferent zeal, benign love and favour which your Highness
  beareth towards both the said parties, that the said articles (if they
  shall be by your most clear and perfect judgment, <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> thought any
  instrument of the said disorders and factions), being deeply and
  weightily, after your accustomed ways and manner, searched and
  considered; graciously to provide (all violence on both sides utterly and
  clearly set apart) some such necessary and behoveful remedies as may
  effectually reconcile and bring in perpetual unity, your said subjects,
  spiritual and temporal; and for the establishment thereof, to make and
  ordain on both sides such strait laws against transgressors and offenders
  as shall be too heavy, dangerous, and weighty for them, or any of them,
  to bear, suffer, and sustain.</p>

  <p>"Whereunto your said Commons most humbly and entirely beseech your
  Grace, as the only Head, Sovereign Lord and Protector of both the said
  parties, in whom and by whom the only and sole redress, reformation, and
  remedy herein absolutely resteth [of your goodness to consent]. By
  occasion whereof all your Commons in their conscience surely account
  that, beside the marvellous fervent love that your Highness shall thereby
  engender in their hearts towards your Grace, ye shall do the most
  princely feat, and show the most honourable and charitable precedent and
  mirrour that ever did sovereign lord upon his subjects; and therewithal
  merit and deserve of our merciful God eternal bliss&mdash;whose goodness
  grant your Grace in goodly, princely, and honourable estate long to
  reign, prosper, and continue as the Sovereign Lord over all your said
  most humble and obedient servants."<a name="NtA_226"></a><a
  href="#Nt_226"><sup>226</sup></a></p>

  <p>But little comment need be added in explanation of this petition,
  which, though drawn with evident haste, is no less remarkable for temper
  and good feeling, than for the masterly clearness with which the evils
  complained of are laid bare. Historians will be careful for the future
  how they swell the charges against Wolsey with quoting the lamentations
  of Archbishop Warham, when his Court of Arches was for a while superseded
  by the Legate's Court, and causes lingering before his commissaries were
  summarily dispatched at a higher tribunal.<a name="NtA_227"></a><a
  href="#Nt_227"><sup>227</sup></a> The archbishop professed, indeed, that
  he derived no personal advantage from his courts,<a name="NtA_228"></a><a
  href="#Nt_228"><sup>228</sup></a> and as we have only the popular
  impression to the contrary to set against his word, we must believe him;
  yet it was of small moment to the laity who were pillaged, whether the
  spoils taken from them filled the coffers of the master, or those of his
  followers and friends.</p>

<!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>

  <p>When we consider, also, the significant allusion<a
  name="NtA_229"></a><a href="#Nt_229"><sup>229</sup></a> to the young
  folks whom the bishops called their nephews, we cease to wonder at their
  lenient dealing with the poor priests who had sunk under the temptations
  of frail humanity; and still less can we wonder at the rough handling
  which was soon found necessary to bring back these high dignitaries to a
  better mind.</p>

  <p>The House of Commons, in casting their grievances into the form of a
  petition, showed that they had no desire to thrust forward of themselves
  violent measures of reform; they sought rather to explain firmly and
  decisively what the country required. The king, selecting out of the many
  points noticed those which seemed most immediately pressing, referred
  them back to the parliament, with a direction to draw up such enactments
  as in their own judgment would furnish effective relief. In the meantime
  he submitted the petition itself to the consideration of the bishops,
  requiring their immediate answer to the charges against them, and
  accompanied this request with a further important requisition. The
  legislative authority of convocation lay at the root of the evils which
  were most complained of. The bishops and clergy held themselves
  independent of either crown or parliament, passing canons by their own
  irresponsible and unchecked will, irrespective of the laws of the land,
  and sometimes in direct violation of them; and to these canons the laity
  were amenable without being made acquainted with their provisions,
  learning them only in the infliction of penalties for their unintended
  breach. The king required that thenceforward the convocation should
  consent to place itself in the position of parliament, and that his own
  consent should be required and received before any law passed by
  convocation should have the force of statute.<a name="NtA_230"></a><a
  href="#Nt_230"><sup>230</sup></a></p>

  <p>Little notion, indeed, could the bishops have possessed of the
  position in which they were standing. It seemed as if they literally
  believed that the promise of perpetuity which Christ had made to his
  church was a charm which would hold them free in the quiet course of
  their injustice; or else, under the blinding influence of custom, they
  did not really know that any injustice adhered to them. They could see in
  themselves only the ideal virtues of their saintly office, and not the
  vices <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>[pg
  137]</span> of their fragile humanity; they believed that they were still
  holy, still spotless, still immaculate, and therefore that no danger
  might come near them. It cannot have been but that, before the minds of
  such men as Warham and Fisher, some visions of a future must at times
  have floated, which hung so plainly before the eyes of Wolsey and of Sir
  Thomas More.<a name="NtA_231"></a><a href="#Nt_231"><sup>231</sup></a>
  They could not have been wholly deaf to the storm in Germany; and they
  must have heard something of the growls of smothered anger which for
  years had been audible at home, to all who had ears to hear.<a
  name="NtA_232"></a><a href="#Nt_232"><sup>232</sup></a> Yet if any such
  thoughts at times did cross their imagination, they were thrust aside as
  an uneasy dream, to be shaken off like a nightmare, or with the coward's
  consolation, "It will last my time." If the bishops ever felt an uneasy
  moment, there is no trace of uneasiness in the answer which they sent in
  to the king, and which now, when we read it with the light which is
  thrown back out of the succeeding years, seems like the composition of
  mere lunacy. Perhaps they had confidence in the support of Henry. In
  their courts they were in the habit of identifying an attack upon
  themselves with an attack upon the doctrines of the Church; and reading
  the king's feelings in their own, they may have considered themselves
  safe under the protection of a sovereign who had broken a lance with
  Luther, and had called himself the Pope's champion. Perhaps they thought
  that they had bound him to themselves by a declaration which they had all
  signed in the preceding summer in favour of the divorce.<a
  name="NtA_233"></a><a href="#Nt_233"><sup>233</sup></a> Perhaps they were
  but steeped in the dulness of official lethargy. The defence is long,
  wearying the patience to read it; wearying the imagination to invent
  excuses for the falsehoods which it contains. Yet it is well to see all
  men in the light in which they see themselves; and justice requires that
  we allow the bishops the benefit of their own reply. It was couched in
  the following words:&mdash;<a name="NtA_234"></a><a
  href="#Nt_234"><sup>234</sup></a></p>

  <p>"After our most humble wise, with our most bounden duty of honour and
  reverence to your excellent Majesty, endued from God with incomparable
  wisdom and goodness. Please it the same to understand that we, your
  orators and daily bounden bedemen, have read and perused a certain
  supplication which <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span> the Commons of your Grace's honourable
  parliament now assembled have offered unto your Highness, and by your
  Grace's commandment delivered unto us, that we should make answer
  thereunto. We have, as the time hath served, made this answer following,
  beseeching your Grace's indifferent benignity graciously to hear the
  same.</p>

  <p>"And first for that discord, variance, and debate which, in the
  preface of the said supplication they do allege to have risen among your
  Grace's subjects, spiritual and temporal, occasioned, as they say, by the
  uncharitable behaviour and demeanour of divers ordinaries: to this we,
  the ordinaries, answer, assuring your Majesty that in our hearts there is
  no such discord or variance ort our part against our brethren in God and
  ghostly children your subjects, as is induced in this preface; but our
  daily prayer is and shall be that all peace and concord may increase
  among your Grace's true subjects our said children, whom God be our
  witness we love, have loved, and shall love ever with hearty affection;
  never intending any hurt ne harm towards any of them in soul or body; ne
  have we ever enterprised anything against them of trouble, vexation, or
  displeasure; but only have, with all charity, exercised the spiritual
  jurisdiction of the Church, as we are bound of duty, upon certain
  evil-disposed persons infected with the pestilent poison of heresy. And
  to have peace with such had been against the Gospel of our Saviour
  Christ, wherein he saith, <i>Non veni mittere pacem sed gladium</i>.
  Wherefore, forasmuch as we know well that there be as well-disposed and
  well-conscienced men of your Grace's Commons in no small number
  assembled, as ever we knew at any time in parliament; and with that
  consider how on our part there is given no such occasion why the whole
  number of the spirituality and clergy should be thus noted unto your
  Highness; we humbling our hearts to God and remitting the judgment of
  this our inquietation to Him, and trusting, as his Scripture teacheth,
  that if we love him above all, omnia cooperabuntur in bonum, shall
  endeavour to declare to your Highness the innocency of us, your poor
  orators.</p>

  <p>"And where, after the general preface of the same supplication, your
  Grace's Commons descend to special particular griefs, and first to those
  divers fashions of laws concerning temporal things, whereon, as they say,
  the clergy in their convocation have made and daily do make divers laws,
  to their great trouble and inquietation, which said laws be sometimes
  repugnant to the statutes of your Realm, with many other complaints
  thereupon:<a name="NtA_235"></a><a href="#Nt_235"><sup>235</sup></a> <!--
  Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>
  To this we say, that forasmuch as we repute and take our authority of
  making of laws to be grounded upon the Scriptures of God and the
  determination of Holy Church, which must be the rule and square to try
  the justice and righteousness of all laws, as well spiritual as temporal,
  we verily trust that in such laws as have been made by us, or by our
  predecessors, the same being sincerely interpreted, and after the meaning
  of the makers, there shall be found nothing contained in them but such as
  may be well justified by the said rule and square. And if it shall
  otherwise appear, as it is our duty whereunto we shall always most
  diligently apply ourselves to reform our ordinances to God's commission,
  and to conform our statutes to the determination of Scripture and Holy
  Church; <i>so we hope in God, and shall daily pray for the same, that
  your Highness will, if there appear cause why, with the assent of your
  people, temper your Grace's laws accordingly; whereby shall ensue a most
  sure and hearty conjunction and agreement; God being lapis
  angularis</i>.</p>

  <p>"And as concerning the requiring of your Highness's royal assent to
  the authorising of such laws as have been made by our predecessors, or
  shall be made by us, in such points and articles, as we have authority to
  rule and order; we knowing your Highness's wisdom, virtue, and learning,
  nothing doubt but that the same perceiveth how the granting thereunto
  dependeth not upon our will and liberty, <i>and that we may not submit
  the execution of our charges and duty certainly prescribed to us by God
  to your Highness's assent</i>; although, indeed, the same is most worthy
  for your most princely and excellent virtues, not only to give your royal
  assent, but also to devise and command what we should for good order or
  manners by statutes and laws provide in the church. Nevertheless, we
  considering we may not so nor in such sort restrain the doing of our
  office in the feeding and ruling of Christ's people, we most humbly
  desire your Grace (as the same hath done heretofore) to show your Grace's
  mind and opinion unto us, which we shall most gladly hear and follow if
  it shall please God to inspire us so to do; and with all humility we
  therefore beseech your Grace, following the steps of your most noble
  progenitors, to maintain and defend such laws and ordinances as we,
  according to our calling and by the authority of God, shall for his
  honour make to the edification of virtue and the maintaining of Christ's
  faith, whereof your Highness is defender in name, and hath been hitherto
  indeed a special protector.</p>

<!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>

  <p>"Furthermore, where there be found in the said supplication, with
  mention of your Grace's person, other griefs that some of the said laws
  extend to the goods and possessions of your said lay subjects, declaring
  the transgressors not only to fall under the terrible censure of
  excommunication, but also under the detestable crime of heresy:</p>

  <p>"To this we answer that we remember no such, and yet if there be any
  such, it is but according to the common law of the Church, and also to
  your Grace's law, which determine and decree that every person spiritual
  or temporal condemned of heresy shall forfeit his moveables or
  immoveables to your Highness, or to the lord spiritual or temporal that
  by law hath right to them.<a name="NtA_236"></a><a
  href="#Nt_236"><sup>236</sup></a> Other statutes we remember none that
  toucheth lands or goods. If there be, it were good that they were brought
  forth to be weighed and pondered accordingly.</p>

  <p>"Item as touching the second principal article of the said
  supplication, where they say that divers and many of your Grace's
  obedient subjects, and especially they that be of the poorest sort, be
  daily called before us or before our substitutes ex officio; sometimes at
  the pleasure of us, the ordinaries, without any probable cause, and
  sometimes at the only promotion of our summoner, without any credible
  fame first proved against them, and without presentment in the visitation
  or lawful accusation:</p>

  <p>"On this we desire your high wisdom and learning to consider that
  albeit in the ordering of Christ's people, your Grace's subjects, God of
  His spiritual goodness assisteth his church, and inspireth by the Holy
  Ghost as we verily trust such rules and laws as tend to the wealth of his
  elect folk; yet upon considerations to man unknown, his infinite wisdom
  leaveth or permitteth men to walk in their infirmity and frailty; so that
  we cannot ne will arrogantly presume of ourselves, as though being in
  name spiritual men, we were also in all our acts and doings clean and
  void from all temporal affections and carnality of this world, or that
  the laws of the church made for spiritual and ghostly purpose be not
  sometime applied to worldly intent. This we ought and do lament, as
  becometh us, very sore. Nevertheless, as the evil deeds of men be the
  mere defaults of those particular men, and not of the whole order of the
  clergy, nor of the law wholesomely by them made; our request and petition
  shall be with all humility and reverence; that laws well made be not
  therefore called evil because by all men and at all times they be not
  well <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[pg
  141]</span> executed; and that in such defaults as shall appear such
  distribution may be used <i>ut unusquisque onus suum portet</i>, and
  remedy be found to reform the offenders; unto the which your Highness
  shall perceive as great towardness in your said orators as can be
  required upon declaration of particulars. And other answer than this
  cannot be made in the name of your whole clergy, for though <i>in multis
  offendimus omnes</i>, as St. James saith, yet not 'in omnibus offendimus
  omnes;' and the whole number can neither justify ne condemn particular
  acts to them unknown but thus. He that calleth a man ex officio for
  correction of sin, doeth well. He that calleth men for pleasure or
  vexation, doeth evil. Summoners should be honest men. If they offend in
  their office, they should be punished. To prove first [their faults]
  before men be called, is not necessary. He that is called according to
  the laws ex officio or otherwise, cannot complain. He that is otherwise
  ordered should have by reason convenient recompence and so forth; that is
  well to be allowed, and misdemeanour when it appeareth to be
  reproved.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say in the same article that upon their appearance ex
  officio at the only pleasure of the ordinaries, they be committed to
  prison without bail or mainprize; and there they lie some half a year or
  more before they come to their deliverance; to this we answer,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"That we use no prison before conviction but for sure custody, and
  only of such as be suspected of heresy, in which crime, thanked be God,
  there hath fallen no such notable person in our time, or of such
  qualities as hath given occasion of any sinister suspicion to be
  conceived of malice or hatred to his person other than the heinousness of
  their crime deserveth. <i>Truth it is that certain apostates, friars,
  monks, lewd priests, bankrupt merchants, vagabonds, and lewd idle fellows
  of corrupt intent, have embraced the abominable and erroneous opinions
  lately sprung in Germany</i>; and by them some have been seduced in
  simplicity and ignorance. Against these, if judgment has been exercised
  according to the laws of the church, and conformably to the laws of this
  realm, we be without blame. If we have been too remiss and slack, we
  shall gladly do our duty from henceforth. If any man hath been, under
  pretence of this [crime], particularly offended, it were pity to suffer
  any man to be wronged; and thus it ought to be, and otherwise we cannot
  answer, no man's special case being declared in the said petition.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say further that they so appearing ex officio, be
  condemned to answer to many subtle questions by the <!-- Page 142
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span> which a
  simple, unlearned, or else a well-witted layman without learning
  sometimes is, and commonly may be trapped and induced into peril of open
  penance to their shame, or else [forced] to redeem their penance for
  money, as is commonly used; to this we answer that we should not use
  subtlety, for we should do all things plainly and openly; and if we do
  otherwise, we do amiss. We ought not to ask questions, but after the
  capacities of the man. Christ hath defended his true doctrine and faith
  in his Catholic church from all subtlety, and so preserved good men in
  the same, as they have not (blessed be God) been vexed, inquieted, or
  troubled in Christ's church. Thereupon evil men fall in danger by their
  own subtlety; we protest afore God we have neither known, read, nor heard
  of any one man damaged or prejudiced by spiritual jurisdiction in this
  behalf, neither in this realm nor any other, but only by his own deserts.
  Such is the goodness of God in maintaining the cause of his Catholic
  faith.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say they be compelled to do open penance, or else
  redeem the same for money; as for penance, we answer it consisteth in the
  arbitre of a judge who ought to enjoin such penance as might profit for
  correction of the fault. Whereupon we disallow that judge's doing who
  taketh money for penance for lucre or advantage, not regarding the
  reformation of sin as he ought to do. But when open penance may sometimes
  work in certain persons more hurt than good, it is commendable and
  allowable in that case to punish by the purse, and preserve the fame of
  the party; foreseeing always the money be converted <i>in usus pios et
  eleemosynam</i>, and thus we think of the thing, and that the offenders
  should be punished.</p>

  <p>"Item where they complain that two witnesses be admitted, be they
  never so defamed, of little truth or credence, adversaries or enemies to
  the parties; yet in many cases they be allowed by the discretion of the
  ordinaries to put the party defamed, ex officio, to open penance, and
  then to redemption for money; so that every of your subjects, upon the
  only will of the ordinaries or their substitutes, without any accuser,
  proved fame, or presentment, is or may be infamed, vexed, and troubled,
  to the peril of their lives, their shames, costs, and expenses:</p>

  <p>"To this we reply, <i>the Gospel of Christ teacheth us to believe two
  witnesses; and as the cause is, so the judge must esteem the quality of
  the witness; and in heresy no exception is necessary to be considered if
  their tale be likely; which hath been highly provided lest heretics
  without jeopardy might else plant their</i> <!-- Page 143 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> <i>heresies in lewd
  and light persons, and taking exception to the witnesses, take boldness
  to continue their folly. This is the universal law of Christendom, and
  hath universally done good. Of any injury done to any man thereby we know
  not</i>.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say it is not intended by them to take away from us
  our authority to correct and punish sins, and especially the detestable
  crime of heresy:</p>

  <p>"To this we answer, in the prosecuting heretics we regard our duty and
  office whereunto we be called, and if God will discharge us thereof, or
  cease that plague universal, as, by directing the hearts of princes, and
  specially the heart of your Highness (laud and thanks be unto Him), His
  goodness doth commence and begin to do, we should and shall have great
  cause to rejoice; as being our authority therein costly, dangerous, full
  of trouble and business, without any fruit, pleasure, or commodity
  worldly, but a continued conflict and vexation with pertinacity,
  wilfulness, folly, and ignorance, whereupon followeth their bodily and
  ghostly destruction, to our great sorrow.</p>

  <p>"Item where they desire that by assent of your Highness (if the laws
  heretofore made be not sufficient for the repression of heresy) more
  dreadful and terrible laws may be made; this We think is undoubtedly a
  more charitable request than as we trust necessary, considering that by
  the aid of your Highness, and the pains of your Grace's statutes freely
  executed, your realm may be in short time clean purged from the few small
  dregs that do remain, if any do remain.</p>

  <p>"Item where they desire some reasonable declaration may be made to
  your people, how they may, if they will, avoid the peril of heresy. No
  better declaration, we say, can be made than is already by our Saviour
  Christ, the Apostles, and the determination of the church, which if they
  keep, they shall not fail to eschew heresy.</p>

  <p>"Item where they desire that some charitable fashion may be devised by
  your wisdom for the calling of any of your subjects before us, that it
  shall not stand in the only will and pleasure of the ordinaries at their
  own imagination, without lawful accusation by honest witness, according
  to your law; to this we say that a better provision cannot be devised
  than is already devised by the clergy in our opinion; and if any default
  appear in the execution, it shall be amended on declaration of the
  particulars, and the same proved.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say that your subjects be cited out of the diocese
  which they dwell in, and many times be suspended <!-- Page 144 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span> and excommunicate
  for light causes upon the only certificate devised by the proctors, and
  that all your subjects find themselves grieved with the excessive fees
  taken in the spiritual courts:</p>

  <p>"To this article, for because it concerneth specially the spiritual
  courts of me the Archbishop of Canterbury, please it your Grace to
  understand that about twelve months past I reformed certain things
  objected here; and now within these ten weeks I reformed many other
  things in my said courts, as I suppose is not unknown unto your Grace's
  Commons; and some of the fees of the officers of my courts I have brought
  down to halves, some to the third part, and some wholly taken away and
  extincted; and yet it is objected to me as though I had taken no manner
  of reformation therein. Nevertheless I shall not cease yet; but in such
  things as I shall see your Commons most offended I will set redress
  accordingly, so as, I trust, they will be contented in that behalf. And
  I, the said archbishop, beseech your Grace to consider what service the
  doctors in civil law, which have had their practice in my courts, have
  done your Grace concerning treaties, truces, confederations, and leagues
  devised and concluded with outward princes; and that without such learned
  men in civil law your Grace could not have been so conveniently served as
  at all times you have been, which thing, perhaps, when such learned men
  shall fail, will appear more evident than it doth now. The decay whereof
  grieveth me to foresee, not so greatly for any cause concerning the
  pleasure or profit of myself, being a man spent, and at the point to
  depart this world, and having no penny of any advantage by my said
  courts, but principally for the good love which I bear to the honour of
  your Grace and of your realm. And albeit there is, by the assent of the
  Lords Temporal and the Commons of your Parliament, an act passed
  thereupon already, the matter depending before your Majesty by way of
  supplication offered to your Highness by your said Commons;<a
  name="NtA_237"></a><a href="#Nt_237"><sup>237</sup></a> yet, forasmuch as
  we your Grace's humble chaplains, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
  be bounden by oath to be intercessors for the rights of our churches; and
  forasmuch as the spiritual prelates of the clergy, being of your Grace's
  parliament, consented to the said act for divers great causes moving
  their conscience, we your Grace's said chaplains show unto your <!-- Page
  145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>
  Highness that it hath appertained to the Archbishops of Canterbury and
  York for the space of four hundred years or thereabouts to have spiritual
  jurisdiction over all your Grace's subjects dwelling within the
  provinces; and to have authority to call before them, not only in
  spiritual causes devolved to them by way of appeal, but also by way of
  querimony and complaint; which right and privilege pertaineth not only to
  the persons of the said archbishops, but also to the pre-eminences of
  their churches. Insomuch that when the archbishop of either of the sees
  dieth, the said privileges do not only remain to his successor (by which
  he is named Legatus natus), but also in the meantime of vacation the same
  privilege resteth in the churches of Canterbury and York; and is executed
  by the prior, dean and chapter of the said churches; and so the said act
  is directly against the liberty and privileges of the churches of
  Canterbury and York; and what dangers be to them which study and labour
  to take away the liberties and privileges of the church, whoso will read
  the general councils of Christendom and the canons of the fathers of the
  Catholic church ordained in that behalf, shall soon perceive. And
  further, we think verily that our churches, to which the said privileges
  were granted, can give no cause why the pope himself (whose predecessors
  granted that privilege) or any other (the honour of your Grace ever
  except) may justly take away the same privileges so lawfully prescribed
  from our churches, though we [ourselves] had greatly offended, abusing
  the said privileges. But when in our persons we trust we have given no
  cause why to lose that privilege, we beseech your Grace of your goodness
  and absolute power to set such orders in this behalf as we may enjoy our
  privileges lawfully admitted so long.</p>

  <p>"Item where they complain that there is exacted and demanded in divers
  parishes of this your realm, other manner of tythes than hath been
  accustomed to be paid this hundred years past; and in some parts of this
  your realm there is exacted double tythes, that is to say, threepence, or
  twopence-halfpenny, for one acre, over and beside the tythe for the
  increase of cattle that pastureth the same:</p>

  <p>"To this we say, that tythes being due by God's law, be so duly paid
  (thanked be God), by all good men, as there needeth not exaction in the
  most parts of this your Grace's realm. As for double tythes, they cannot
  be maintained due for one increase; whether in any place they be unduly
  exacted in fact we know not. This we know in learning, that neither a
  hundred <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>[pg
  146]</span> years, nor seven hundred of non-payment, may debar the right
  of God's law. The manner of payment, and person unto whom to pay, may be
  in time altered, but the duty cannot by any means be taken away.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say that when a mortuary is due, curates sometimes,
  before they will demand it, will bring citation for it; and then will not
  receive the mortuaries till they may have such costs as they say they
  have laid out for the suit of the same; when, indeed, if they would first
  have charitably demanded it, they needed not to have sued for the same,
  for it should have been paid with good will:</p>

  <p>"We answer that curates thus offending, if they were known, ought to
  be punished, but who thus doeth we know not.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say that divers spiritual persons being presented to
  benefices within this your realm, we and our ministers do take of them
  great sums of money and reward; we reply that this is a particular abuse,
  and he that taketh reward doeth not well; and if any penny be exacted
  above the accustomed rate and after convenient proportion, it is not well
  done. But in taking the usual fee for the sealing, writing, and
  registering the letters, which is very moderate, we cannot think it to be
  reputed as any offence; neither have we heard any priests in our days
  complain of any excess therein.</p>

  <p>"And where they say in the same article that such as be presented be
  delayed without reasonable cause, to the intent that we the ordinaries
  may have the profit of the benefice during the vacation, unless they will
  pact and convent with us by temporal bonds, whereof some bonds contain
  that we should have part of the profit of the said benefice, which your
  said subjects suppose to be not only against right and conscience, but
  also seemeth to be simony, and contrary to the laws of God:</p>

  <p>"To this we do say that a delay without reasonable cause, and for a
  lucrative intent, is detestable in spiritual men, and the doers cannot
  eschew punishment: but otherwise a delay is sometimes expedient to
  examine the clerk, and sometimes necessary when the title is in variance.
  All other bargains and covenants being contrary to the law ought to be
  punished, as the quality is of the offence more or less, as simony or
  inordinate covetousness.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say that we give benefices to our nephews and
  kinsfolk, being in young age or infants, whereby the cure is not
  substantially looked into, nor the parishioners taught as they should be;
  we reply to this that the thing which is not lawful in <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span> others is
  in spiritual men more detestable. Benefices should be disposed of not
  <i>secundum carnem et sanguinem, sed secundum merita</i>. And when there
  is a default it is not authorised by the clergy as good, but reproved;
  whereupon in this the clergy is not to be blamed, but the default as it
  may appear must be laid to particular men.</p>

  <p>"And where they say that we take the profit of such benefices for the
  time of the minority of our said kinsfolk, if it be done to our own use
  and profit it is not well; <i>if it be bestowed to the bringing up and
  use of the same parties</i>, or applied to the maintenance of the church
  and God's service, or distributed among the poor, we do not see but that
  it may be allowed.</p>

  <p>"Item where they say that divers and many spiritual persons, not
  contented with the convenient livings and promotions of the church, daily
  intromit and exercise themselves in secular offices and rooms, as
  stewards, receivers, auditors, bailiffs, and other temporal occupations,
  withdrawing themselves from the good contemplative lives that they have
  professed, not only to the damage but also to the perilous example of
  your loving and obedient subjects; to this we your bedesmen answer that
  beneficed men may lawfully be stewards and receivers to their own
  bishops, as it evidently appeareth in the laws of the church; and we by
  the same laws ought to have no other. And as for priests to be auditors
  and bailiffs, we know none such.</p>

  <p>"And where, finally, they, in the conclusion of their supplication, do
  repeat and say that forasmuch as there is at this present time, and by a
  few years past hath been much misdemeanour and violence upon the one
  part, and much default and lack of patience, charity, and good will on
  the other part; and marvellous discord in consequence of the quiet,
  peace, and tranquillity in which this your realm hath been ever hitherto
  preserved through your politic wisdom:</p>

  <p>"To the first part as touching such discord as is reported, and also
  the misdemeanour which is imputed to us and our doings, we trust we have
  sufficiently answered the same, humbly beseeching your Grace so to esteem
  and weigh such answer with their supplication as shall be thought good
  and expedient by your high wisdom. Furthermore we ascertain your Grace as
  touching the violence which they seem to lay to our charge, albeit divers
  of the clergy of this your realm have sundry times been <i>rigorously
  handled, and with much violence entreated by certain ill-disposed and
  seditious persons of the lay fee, have been injured in their bodies,
  thrown down in the kennel in the open</i> <!-- Page 148 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span> <i>streets at
  mid-day</i>, even here within your city and elsewhere, to the great
  rebuke and disquietness of the clergy of your realm, the great danger of
  the souls of the said misdoers, and perilous example of your subjects.
  Yet we think verily, and do affirm the same, that no violence hath been
  so used on our behalf towards your said lay subjects in any case; unless
  they esteem this to be violence that we do use as well for the health of
  their souls as for the discharge of our duties in taking, examining, and
  punishing heretics according to the law: wherein we doubt not but that
  your Grace, and divers of your Grace's subjects, do understand well what
  charitable entreaty we have used with such as have been before us for the
  same cause of heresy; and what means we have devised and studied for
  safeguard specially of their souls; and that charitably, as God be our
  judge, and without violence as [far as] we could possibly devise. In
  execution thereof, and also of the laws of the church for repression of
  sin, and also for reformation of mislivers, it hath been to our great
  comfort that your Grace hath herein of your goodness, assisted and aided
  us in this behalf for the zeal and love which your Grace beareth to God's
  church and to His ministers; especially in defence of His faith whereof
  your Grace only and most worthily amongst all Christian princes beareth
  the title and name. And for that marvellous discord and grudge among your
  subjects as is reported in the supplication of your Commons, we beseech
  your Majesty, all the premises considered, to repress those that be
  misdoers; protesting in our behalf that we ourselves have no grudge nor
  displeasure towards your lay subjects our ghostly children. We intreat
  your Grace of your accustomed goodness to us your bedemen to continue our
  chief protector, defender, and aider in and for the execution of our
  office and duty; specially touching repression of heresy, reformation of
  sin, and due behaviour and order of all your Grace's subjects, spiritual
  and temporal; which (no doubt thereof) shall be much to the pleasure of
  God, great comfort to men's souls, quietness and unity of all your realm;
  and, as we think, most principally to the great comfort of your Grace's
  Majesty. Which we beseech lowly upon our knees, so entirely as we can, to
  be the author of unity, charity, and concord as above, for whose
  preservation we do and shall continually pray to Almighty God long to
  reign and prosper in most honourable estate to his pleasure."</p>

  <p>This was the bishops' defence; the best which, under the
  circumstances, they considered themselves capable of making. <!-- Page
  149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> The
  House of Commons had stated their complaints in the form of special
  notorious facts; the bishops replied with urging the theory of their
  position, and supposed that they could relieve the ecclesiastical system
  from the faults of its ministers, by laying the sole blame on the
  unworthiness of individual persons. The degenerate representatives of a
  once noble institution could not perhaps be expected to admit their
  degeneracy, and confess themselves, as they really were, collectively
  incompetent; yet the defence which they brought forward would have been
  valid only so long as the blemishes were the rare exceptions in the
  working of an institution which was still generally beneficent. It was no
  defence at all when the faults had become the rule, and when there was no
  security in the system itself for the selection of worth and capacity to
  exercise its functions. The clergy, as I have already said, claimed the
  privileges of saints, while their conduct fell below the standard of that
  of ordinary men; and the position taken in this answer was tenable only
  on the hypothesis which it, in fact, deliberately asserted, that the
  judicial authority of the church had been committed to it by God Himself;
  and that no misconduct of its ministers in detail could forfeit their
  claims or justify resistance to them.</p>

  <p>There is something touching in the bishops' evidently sincere
  unconsciousness that there could be real room for blame. Warham, who had
  been Archbishop of Canterbury thirty years, took credit to himself for
  the reforms which, under the pressure of public opinion, he had
  introduced, in the last few weeks or months; and did not know that in
  doing so he had passed sentence on a life of neglect. In the opinion of
  the entire bench no infamy, however notorious, could shake the testimony
  of a witness in a case of heresy; no cruelty was unjust when there was
  suspicion of so horrible a crime; while the appointment of minors to
  church benefices (not to press more closely the edge of the accusation)
  they admitted while they affected to deny it; since they were not ashamed
  to defend the appropriation of the proceeds of benefices occupied by such
  persons, if laid out on the education and maintenance of the minors
  themselves.</p>

  <p>Yet these things were as nothing in comparison with the powers claimed
  for convocation; and the prelates of the later years of Henry's reign
  must have looked back with strange sensations at the language which their
  predecessors had so simply addressed to him. If the canons which
  convocation might think good to enact were not consistent with the laws
  of the Realm, "His Majesty" was desired to produce the wished-for <!--
  Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>
  uniformity by altering the laws of the Realm; and although the bishops
  might not submit their laws to His Majesty's approval, they would be
  happy, they told him, to consider such suggestions as he might think
  proper to make. The spirit of the Plantagenets must have slumbered long
  before such words as these could have been addressed to an English
  sovereign, and little did the bishops dream that these light words were
  the spell which would burst the charm, and bid that spirit wake again in
  all its power and terror.</p>

  <p>The House of Commons in the mean time had not been idle. To them the
  questions at issue were unincumbered with theoretic difficulties.
  Enormous abuses had been long ripe for dissolution, and there was no
  occasion to waste time in unnecessary debates. At such a time, with a
  House practically unanimous, business could be rapidly transacted, the
  more rapidly indeed in proportion to its importance. In six weeks, for so
  long only the session lasted, the astonished church authorities saw bill
  after bill hurried up before the Lords, by which successively the
  pleasant fountains of their incomes would be dried up to flow no longer;
  or would flow only in shallow rivulets along the beds of the once
  abundant torrents, The jurisdiction of the spiritual courts was not
  immediately curtailed, and the authority which was in future to be
  permitted to convocation lay over for further consideration, to be dealt
  with in another manner. But probate duties and legacy duties, hitherto
  assessed at discretion, were dwarfed into fixed proportions,<a
  name="NtA_238"></a><a href="#Nt_238"><sup>238</sup></a> not to touch the
  poorer laity any more, and bearing even upon wealth with a reserved and
  gentle hand. Mortuaries were shorn of their luxuriance; when effects were
  small, no mortuary should be required; when large, the clergy should
  content themselves with a modest share. No velvet cloaks should be
  stripped any more from strangers' bodies to save them from a rector's
  grasp;<a name="NtA_239"></a><a href="#Nt_239"><sup>239</sup></a> no
  shameful battles with apparitors should disturb any more the recent rest
  of the dead.<a name="NtA_240"></a><a href="#Nt_240"><sup>240</sup></a>
  Such sums as the law would permit should be paid thenceforward in the
  form of decent funeral fees for householders dying in their own parishes,
  and there the exactions should terminate.<a name="NtA_241"></a><a
  href="#Nt_241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>

  <p>The carelessness of the bishops in the discharge of their most
  immediate duties obliged the legislature to trespass also in the
  provinces purely spiritual, and undertake the discipline of the clergy.
  The Commons had complained in their petition that the clergy, instead of
  attending to their duties, were acting as auditors, bailiffs, stewards,
  or in other capacities, as laymen; they were engaged in trade also, in
  farming, in tanning, in brewing, in doing anything but the duties which
  they were paid for doing; while they purchased dispensations for
  non-residence on their benefices; and of these benefices, in favoured
  cases, single priests held as many as eight or nine. It was thought
  unnecessary to wait for the bishops' pleasure to apply a remedy here. If
  the clergy were unjustly accused of these offences, a law of general
  prohibition would not touch them. If the belief of the House of Commons
  was well founded, there was no occasion for longer delay. It was
  therefore enacted<a name="NtA_242"></a><a
  href="#Nt_242"><sup>242</sup></a>&mdash;"for the more quiet and virtuous
  increase and maintenance of divine service, the preaching and teaching
  the Word of God with godly and good example, for the better discharge of
  cures, the maintenance of hospitality, the relief of poor people, the
  increase of devotion and good opinion of the lay fee towards spiritual
  persons"&mdash;that no such persons thenceforward should take any land to
  farm beyond what was necessary, <i>bonâ fide</i>, for the support of
  their own households; that they should not buy merchandise to sell again;
  that they should keep no tanneries or brewhouses, or otherwise directly
  or indirectly trade for gain. Pluralities were not to be permitted with
  benefices above the yearly value of eight pounds, and residence was made
  obligatory under penalty in cases of absence without special reason, of
  ten pounds for each month of such absence. The law against pluralities
  was limited as against existing holders, each of whom, for their natural
  lives, might continue to hold as many as four benefices. But
  dispensations, either <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span> for non-residence or for the violation
  of any other provision of the act, were made penal in a high degree,
  whether obtained from the bishops or from the court of Rome.</p>

  <p>These bills struck hard and struck home. Yet even persons who most
  disapprove of the Reformation will not at the present time either wonder
  at their enactment or complain of their severity. They will be desirous
  rather to disentangle their doctrine from suspicious connection, and will
  not be anxious to compromise their theology by the defence of unworthy
  professors of it.</p>

  <p>The bishops, however, could ill tolerate an interference with the
  privileges of the ecclesiastical order. The Commons, it was exclaimed,
  were heretics and schismatics;<a name="NtA_243"></a><a
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>243</sup></a> the cry was heard everywhere, of Lack
  of faith, Lack of faith; and the lay peers being constitutionally
  conservative, and perhaps instinctively apprehensive of the infectious
  tendencies of innovation, it seemed likely for a time that an effective
  opposition might be raised in the Upper House. The clergy commanded an
  actual majority in that House from their own body, which they might
  employ if they dared; and although they were not likely to venture alone
  on so bold a measure, yet a partial support from the other members was a
  sufficient encouragement. The aged Bishop of Rochester was made the
  spokesman of the ecclesiastics on this occasion. "My Lords," he said,
  "you see daily what bills come hither from the Commons House, and all is
  to the destruction of the church. For God's sake see what a realm the
  kingdom of Bohemia was; and when the church went down, then fell the
  glory of that kingdom. Now with the Commons is nothing but Down with the
  church, and all this meseemeth is for lack of faith only."<a
  name="NtA_244"></a><a href="#Nt_244"><sup>244</sup></a> "In result," says
  Hall, "the acts were sore debated; the Lords Spiritual would in no wise
  consent, and committees of the two Houses sate continually for
  discussion." The spiritualty defended themselves by prescription and
  usage, to which a Gray's Inn lawyer something insolently answered, on one
  occasion, "the usage hath ever been of thieves to rob on Shooter's Hill,
  <i>ergo</i>, it is lawful." "With this answer," continues Hall, "the
  spiritual men were sore offended because their doings were called
  robberies, but the temporal men stood by their sayings, insomuch that the
  said gentlemen declared to the Archbishop of Canterbury, that both the
  exaction of probates of testaments and the taking of mortuaries were open
  robbery and thefts."</p>

<!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>

  <p>At length, people out of doors growing impatient, and dangerous
  symptoms threatening to show themselves, the king summoned a meeting in
  the Star-chamber between eight members of both Houses. The lay peers,
  after some discussion, conclusively gave way; and the bishops, left
  without support, were obliged to yield. They signified their unwilling
  consent, and the bills, "somewhat qualified," were the next day agreed
  to&mdash;"to the great rejoicing of the lay people, and the great
  displeasure of the spiritual persons."<a name="NtA_245"></a><a
  href="#Nt_245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>

  <p>Nor were the House of Commons contented with the substance of victory.
  The reply to their petition had perhaps by that time been made known to
  them, and at any rate they had been accused of sympathy with heresy, and
  they would not submit to the hateful charge without exacting revenge. The
  more clamorous of the clergy out of doors were punished probably by the
  stocks; from among their opponents in the Upper House, Fisher was
  selected for special and signal humiliation. The words of which he had
  made use were truer than the Commons knew; perhaps the latent truth of
  them was the secret cause of the pain which they inflicted; but the
  special anxiety of the English reformers was to disconnect themselves,
  with marked emphasis, from the movement in Germany, and they determined
  to compel the offending bishop to withdraw his words.</p>

  <p>They sent the speaker, Sir Thomas Audeley, to the king, who "very
  eloquently declared what dishonour it was to his Majesty and the realm,
  that they which were elected for the wisest men in the shires, cities,
  and boroughs within the realm of England, should be declared in so noble
  a presence to lack faith." It was equivalent to saying "that they were
  infidels, and no Christians&mdash;as ill as Turks and Saracens."
  Wherefore he "most humbly besought the King's Highness to call the said
  bishop before him, and to cause him to speak more discreetly of such a
  number as was in the Commons House."<a name="NtA_246"></a><a
  href="#Nt_246"><sup>246</sup></a> Henry consented to their request, it is
  likely with no great difficulty, and availed himself of the opportunity
  to read a lesson much needed to the remainder of the bench. He sent for
  Fisher, and with him for the Archbishop of Canterbury, and for six other
  bishops. The speaker's message was laid before them, and they were asked
  what they had to say. It would have been well for the weak trembling old
  men if they could have repeated what they believed and had maintained
  their right to believe it. Bold conduct is ever the most safe; it is
  fatal only when there is <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> courage but for the first step, and
  fails when a second is required to support it. But they were forsaken in
  their hour of calamity, not by courage only, but by prudence, by
  judgment, by conscience itself. The Bishop of Rochester stooped to an
  equivocation too transparent to deceive any one; he said that "he meant
  only the doings of the Bohemians were for lack of faith, and not the
  doings of the Commons House"&mdash;"which saying was confirmed by the
  bishops present." The king allowed the excuse, and the bishops were
  dismissed; but they were dismissed into ignominy, and thenceforward, in
  all Henry's dealings with them, they were treated with contemptuous
  disrespect. For Fisher himself we must feel only sorrow. After
  seventy-six years of a useful and honourable life, which he might have
  hoped to close in a quiet haven, he was launched suddenly upon stormy
  waters, to which he was too brave to yield, which he was too timid to
  contend against; and the frail vessel drifting where the waves drove it,
  was soon piteously to perish.</p>

  <p>Thus triumphant on every side, the parliament, in the middle of
  December, closed its session, and lay England celebrated its exploits as
  a national victory. "The king removed to Greenwich, and there kept his
  Christmas with the queen with great triumph, with great plenty of viands,
  and disguisings, and interludes, to the great rejoicing of his people;"<a
  name="NtA_247"></a><a href="#Nt_247"><sup>247</sup></a> the members of
  the House of Commons, we may well believe, following the royal example in
  town and country, and being the little heroes of the day. Only the
  bishops carried home sad hearts within them, to mourn over the perils of
  the church and the impending end of all things; Fisher, unhappily for
  himself, to listen to the wailings of the Nun of Kent, and to totter
  slowly into treason.</p>

  <p>Here, for the present leaving the clergy to meditate on their future,
  and reconsider the wisdom of their answer to the king respecting the
  ecclesiastical jurisdiction (a point on which they were not the less
  certain to be pressed, because the process upon it was temporarily
  suspended), we must turn to the more painful matter which, for a time
  longer, ran parallel with the domestic reformation, and as yet was unable
  to unite with it. After the departure of Campeggio, the further hearing
  of the divorce cause had been advoked to Rome, where it was impossible
  for Henry to consent to plead; while the appearance of the supposed brief
  had opened avenues of new difficulty which left no hope of a decision
  within the limits of an ordinary lifetime. Henry <!-- Page 155 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> was still, however,
  extremely reluctant<a name="NtA_248"></a><a
  href="#Nt_248"><sup>248</sup></a> to proceed to extremities, and appeal
  to the parliament. He had threatened that he would tolerate no delay, and
  Wolsey had evidently expected that he would not. Queen Catherine's alarm
  had gone so far, that in the autumn she had procured an injunction from
  the pope, which had been posted in the churches of Flanders, menacing the
  king with spiritual censures if he took any further steps.<a
  name="NtA_249"></a><a href="#Nt_249"><sup>249</sup></a> Even this she
  feared that he would disregard, and in March, 1529-30, a second
  inhibition was issued at her request, couched in still stronger
  language.<a name="NtA_250"></a><a href="#Nt_250"><sup>250</sup></a> But
  these measures were needless, or at least premature. Henry expected that
  the display of temper in the country in the late session would produce an
  effect both on the pope and on the emperor; and proposing to send an
  embassy to remonstrate jointly with them on the occasion of the emperor's
  coronation, which was to take place in the spring at Bologna, he had
  recourse in the mean time to an expedient which, though blemished in the
  execution, was itself reasonable and prudent.</p>

  <p>Among the many <i>technical</i> questions which had been raised upon
  the divorce, the most serious was on the validity of the original
  dispensation; a question not only on the sufficiency of the form the
  defects of which the brief had been invented to remedy; but on the more
  comprehensive uncertainty whether Pope Julius had not exceeded his powers
  altogether in granting a dispensation where there was so close affinity.
  No one supposed that the pope could permit a brother to marry a sister; a
  dispensation granted in such a case would be <i>ipso facto</i>
  void.&mdash;Was <!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span> not the dispensation similarly void
  which permitted the marriage of a brother's widow? The advantage which
  Henry expected from raising this difficulty was the transfer of judgment
  from the partial tribunal of Clement to a broader court. The pope could
  not, of course, adjudicate on the extent of his own powers; especially as
  he always declared himself to be ignorant of the law; and the decision of
  so general a question rested either with a general council, or must be
  determined by the consent of Christendom, obtained in some other manner.
  If such general consent declared against the pope, the cause was
  virtually terminated. If there was some approach to a consent against
  him, or even if there was general uncertainty, Henry had a legal pretext
  for declining his jurisdiction, and appealing to a council.</p>

  <p>Thomas Cranmer, then a doctor of divinity at Cambridge,<a
  name="NtA_251"></a><a href="#Nt_251"><sup>251</sup></a> is said to have
  been the person who suggested this ingenious expedient, and to have
  advised the king, as the simplest means of carrying it out, to consult in
  detail the universities and learned men throughout Europe. His notorious
  activity in collecting the opinions may have easily connected him with
  the origination of the plan, which probably occurred to many other
  persons as well as to him; but whoever was the first adviser, it was
  immediately acted upon, and English agents were despatched into Germany,
  Italy, and France, carrying with them all means of persuasion,
  intellectual, moral, and material, which promised to be of most cogent
  potency with lawyers' convictions.</p>

  <p>This matter was in full activity when the Earl of Wiltshire, Anne
  Boleyn's father, with Cranmer, the Bishop of London, and Edward Lee,
  afterwards Archbishop of York, was despatched to Bologna to lay Henry's
  remonstrances before the emperor, who was come at last in person to enjoy
  his miserable triumph, and receive from the pope the imperial crown. Sir
  Nicholas Carew, who had been sent forward a few weeks previously,
  described in piteous language the state to which Italy had been reduced
  by him. Passing through Pavia, the English emissary saw the children
  crying about the streets for bread, and dying of hunger; the grapes in
  midwinter rotting on the vines, because there was no one to gather them;
  and for fifty miles scarcely a single creature, man or woman, in the
  fields. "They say," added Carew, "and the pope also showed us the same,
  that the whole people of that country, with divers other places in
  Italia, <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>[pg
  157]</span> with war, famine, and pestilence, are utterly dead and
  gone."<a name="NtA_252"></a><a href="#Nt_252"><sup>252</sup></a> Such had
  been the combined work of the vanity of Francis and the cold selfishness
  of Charles; and now the latter had arrived amidst the ruins which he had
  made, to receive his crown from the hands of a pope who was true to
  Italy, if false to all the world besides, and whom, but two years before,
  he had imprisoned and disgraced. We think of Clement as the creature of
  the emperor, and such substantially he allowed himself to be; but his
  obedience was the obedience of fear to a master whom he hated, and the
  bishop of Tarbès, who was present at the coronation, and stood at his
  side through the ceremony, saw him trembling under his robes with
  emotion, and heard him sigh bitterly.<a name="NtA_253"></a><a
  href="#Nt_253"><sup>253</sup></a> Very unwillingly, we may be assured, he
  was compelled to act his vacillating part to England, and England, at
  this distance of time, may forgive him for faults to which she owes her
  freedom, and need not refuse him some tribute of sympathy in his
  sorrows.</p>

  <p>Fallen on evil times, which greater wisdom and greater courage than
  had for many a century been found in the successors of St. Peter would
  have failed to encounter successfully, Clement VII. remained, with all
  his cowardice, a true Italian; his errors were the errors of his age and
  nation, and were softened by the presence, in more than usual measure, of
  Italian genius and grace. Benvenuto Cellini, who describes his character
  with much minuteness, has left us a picture of a hot-tempered, but
  genuine and kind-hearted man, whose taste was elegant, and whose wit,
  from the playful spirit with which it was pervaded, and from a certain
  tendency to innocent levity, approached to humour. He was liable to
  violent bursts of feeling; and his inability to control himself, his
  gesticulations, his exclamations, and his tears, all represent to us a
  person who was an indifferent master of the tricks of dissimulation to
  which he was reduced, and whose weakness entitles him to pity, if not to
  respect. The papacy had fallen to him at the crisis of its deepest
  degradation. It existed as a politically organised institution, which it
  was convenient to maintain, but from which the private hearts of all men
  had fallen away; and it depended for its very life upon the support which
  the courts of <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span> Europe would condescend to extend to
  it. Among these governments, therefore, distracted as they were by mutual
  hostility, the pope was compelled to make his choice; and the fatality of
  his position condemned him to quarrel with the only prince on whom, at
  the outset of these complications, he had a right to depend.</p>

  <p>In 1512, France had been on the point of declaring her religious
  independence; and as late as 1525, Francis entertained thoughts of
  offering the patriarchate to Wolsey.<a name="NtA_254"></a><a
  href="#Nt_254"><sup>254</sup></a> Charles V., postponing his religious
  devotion for the leisure of old age, had reserved the choice of his
  party, to watch events and to wait upon opportunity; while, from his
  singular position, he wielded in one hand the power of Catholic Spain, in
  the other that of Protestant Germany, ready to strike with either, as
  occasion or necessity recommended. If his Spaniards had annexed the New
  World to the papacy, his German lanzknechts had stormed the Holy City,
  murdered cardinals, and outraged the pope's person: while both Charles
  and Francis, alike caring exclusively for their private interests, had
  allowed the Turks to overrun Hungary, to conquer Rhodes, and to collect
  an armament at Constantinople so formidable as to threaten Italy itself,
  and the very Christian faith. Henry alone had shown hitherto a true
  feeling for religion; Henry had made war with Louis XII. solely in the
  pope's quarrel; Henry had broken an old alliance with the emperor to
  revenge the capture of Rome, and had won Francis back to his allegiance.
  To Henry, if to any one, the Roman bishop had a right to look with
  confidence. But the power of England was far off, and could not reach to
  Rome. Francis had been baffled and defeated, his armies destroyed, his
  political influence in the Peninsula annihilated. The practical choice
  which remained to Clement lay only, as it seemed, between the emperor and
  martyrdom; and having, perhaps, a desire for the nobler alternative, yet
  being without the power to choose it, his wishes and his conduct, his
  words to private persons and his open actions before the world, were in
  perpetual contradiction. He submitted while his heart revolted; and while
  at Charles's dictation he was threatening Henry with excommunication if
  he proceeded further with his divorce, he was able at that very time to
  say, in confidence, to the Bishop of Tarbès, that he would be <!-- Page
  159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span> well
  contented if the King of England would marry on his own responsibility,
  availing himself of any means which he might possess among his own
  people, so only that he himself was not committed to a consent or the
  privileges of the papacy were not trenched upon.<a name="NtA_255"></a><a
  href="#Nt_255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>

  <p>Two years later, when the course which the pope would really pursue
  under such circumstances was of smaller importance, Henry gave him an
  opportunity of proving the sincerity of this language; and the result was
  such as he expected it to be. As yet, however, he had not relinquished
  the hope of succeeding by a more open course.</p>

  <p>In March, 1529-30, the English ambassadors appeared at Bologna. Their
  instructions were honest, manly, and straightforward. They were directed
  to explain, <i>ab initio</i>, the grounds of the king's proceedings, and
  to appeal to the emperor's understanding of the obligations of princes.
  Full restitution was to be offered of Catherine's dowry, and the Earl of
  Wiltshire was provided with letters of credit adequate to the amount.<a
  name="NtA_256"></a><a href="#Nt_256"><sup>256</sup></a> If these
  proposals were not accepted, they were to assume a more peremptory tone,
  and threaten the alienation of England; and if menaces were equally
  ineffectual, they were to declare that Henry, having done all which lay
  within his power to effect his purpose with the goodwill of his friends,
  since he could not do as he would, must now do as he could, and discharge
  his conscience. If the emperor should pretend that he would "abide the
  law, and would defer to the pope," they were to say, "that the sacking of
  Rome by the Spaniards and Germans had so discouraged the pope and
  cardinals, that they feared for body and goods," and had ceased to be
  free agents; and concluding finally that the king would fear God rather
  than man, and would rely on comfort from the Saviour against those who
  abused their authority, they were then to withdraw.<a
  name="NtA_257"></a><a href="#Nt_257"><sup>257</sup></a> The tone of the
  directions was not sanguine, and the political complications of Europe,
  on which the emperor's reply must more or less have depended, were too
  involved to allow us to trace the influences which were likely to have
  weighed with him. There seems no primâ facie reason, however, why the
  attempt might not have been successful. <!-- Page 160 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span> The revolutionary
  intrigues in England had decisively failed, and the natural sympathy of
  princes, and a desire to detach Henry from Francis, must have combined to
  recommend a return of the old cordiality which had so long existed
  between the sovereigns of England and Flanders. But whatever was the
  cause, the opening interview assured the Earl of Wiltshire that he had
  nothing to look for. He was received with distant courtesy; but Charles
  at once objected even to hearing his instructions, as an interested
  party.<a name="NtA_258"></a><a href="#Nt_258"><sup>258</sup></a> The earl
  replied that he stood there, not as the father of the queen's rival, but
  as the representative of his sovereign; but the objection declared the
  attitude which Charles was resolved to maintain, and which, in fact, he
  maintained throughout. "The emperor," wrote Lord Wiltshire to Henry, "is
  stiffly bent against your Grace's matter, and is most earnest in it;
  while the pope is led by the emperor, and neither will nor dare displease
  him."<a name="NtA_259"></a><a href="#Nt_259"><sup>259</sup></a> From that
  quarter, so long as parties remained in their existing attitude, there
  was no hope. It seems to have been hinted, indeed, that if war broke out
  again between Charles and Francis, something might be done as the price
  of Henry's surrendering the French alliance;<a name="NtA_260"></a><a
  href="#Nt_260"><sup>260</sup></a> but the suggestion, if it was made, was
  probably ironical; and as Charles was unquestionably acting against his
  interest in rejecting the English overtures, it is fair to give him
  credit for having acted on this one occasion of his life, upon generous
  motives. A respectful compliment was paid to his conduct by Henry himself
  in the reproaches which he addressed to the pope.<a name="NtA_261"></a><a
  href="#Nt_261"><sup>261</sup></a></p>

  <p>So terminated the first and the last overture on this subject which
  Henry attempted with Charles V. The ambassadors remained but a few days
  at Bologna, and then discharged their commission and returned. The pope,
  however, had played his part with remarkable skill, and by finessing
  dexterously behind the scenes, had contrived to prevent the precipitation
  of a rupture with himself. His simple and single wish was to gain time,
  trusting to accident or Providence to deliver him from his dilemma. On
  the one hand, he yielded to the emperor in refusing to consent to Henry's
  demand; on the other, he availed <!-- Page 161 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span> himself of all the
  intricacies to parry Catherine's demand for a judgment in her favour. He
  even seemed to part with the emperor on doubtful terms. "The latter,"
  said the Bishop of Tarbès,<a name="NtA_262"></a><a
  href="#Nt_262"><sup>262</sup></a> "before leaving Bologna, desired his
  Holiness to place two cardinals' hats at his disposal, to enable him to
  reward certain services." His Holiness ventured to refuse. During his
  imprisonment, he said he had been compelled to nominate several persons
  for that office whose conduct had been a disgrace to their rank; and when
  the emperor denied his orders, the pope declared that he had seen them.
  The cardinals' hats, therefore, should be granted only when they were
  deserved, "when the Lutherans in Germany had been reduced to obedience,
  and Hungary had been recovered from the Turks." If this was acting, it
  was skilfully managed, and it deceived the eyes of the French
  ambassador.</p>

  <p>Still further to gratify Henry, the pope made a public declaration
  with respect to the dispute which had arisen on the extent of his
  authority, desiring, or professing to desire, that all persons whatever
  throughout Italy should be free to express their opinions without fear of
  incurring his displeasure. This declaration, had it been honestly meant,
  would have been creditable to Clement's courage: unfortunately for his
  reputation, his outward and his secret actions seldom corresponded, and
  the emperor's agents were observed to use very dissimilar language in his
  name. The double policy, nevertheless, was still followed to secure
  delay. Delay was his sole aim,&mdash;either that Catherine's death, or
  his own, or Henry's, or some relenting in one or other of the two princes
  who held their minatory arms extended over him, might spare himself and
  the church the calamity of a decision. For to the church any decision was
  fatal. If he declared for Charles, England would fall from it; if for
  Henry, Germany and Flanders were lost irrecoverably, and Spain itself
  might follow. His one hope was to procrastinate; and in this policy of
  hesitation for two more years he succeeded, till at length the patience
  of Henry and of England was worn out, and all was ended. When the emperor
  required sentence to be passed, he pretended to be about to yield; and at
  the last moment, some technical difficulty ever interfered to make a
  decision impossible. When Henry was cited to appear at Rome, a point of
  law was raised upon the privilege of kings, threatening to open into
  other points of law, and so to multiply to infinity. The pope, indeed,
  finding his own ends so well <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span> answered by evasion, imagined that it
  would answer equally those of the English nation, and he declared to
  Henry's secretary that "if the King of England would send a mandate ad
  totam causam, then if his Highness would, there might be given so many
  delays by reason of matters which his Highness might lay in, and the
  remissorials that his Grace might ask, ad partes, that peradventure in
  ten years or longer a sentence should not be given."<a
  name="NtA_263"></a><a href="#Nt_263"><sup>263</sup></a> In point of
  worldly prudence, his conduct was unexceptionably wise; but something
  beyond worldly prudence was demanded of a tribunal which claimed to be
  inspired by the Holy Ghost.</p>

  <p>The dreary details of the negotiations I have no intention of
  pursuing. They are of no interest to any one,&mdash;a miserable tissue of
  insincerity on one side, and hesitating uncertainty on the other. There
  is no occasion for us to weary ourselves with the ineffectual efforts to
  postpone an issue which was sooner or later inevitable.</p>

  <p>I may not pass over in similar silence another unpleasant episode in
  this business,&mdash;the execution of Cranmer's project for collecting
  the sentiments of Europe on the pope's dispensing power. The details of
  this transaction are not wearying only, but scandalous; and while the
  substantial justice of Henry's cause is a reason for deploring the means
  to which he allowed himself to be driven in pursuing it, we may not
  permit ourselves either to palliate those means or to conceal them. The
  project seemed a simple one, and likely to be effective and useful.
  Unhappily, the appeal was still to ecclesiastics, to a body of men who
  were characterised throughout Europe by a universal absence of integrity,
  who were incapable of pronouncing an honest judgment, and who courted
  intimidation and bribery by the readiness with which they submitted to be
  influenced by them. Corruption was resorted to on all sides with the most
  lavish unscrupulousness, and the result arrived at was general discredit
  to all parties, and a conclusion which added but one more circle to the
  labyrinth of perplexities. Croke,<a name="NtA_264"></a><a
  href="#Nt_264"><sup>264</sup></a> a Doctors' Commons lawyer, who was
  employed in Italy, described the state of feeling in the peninsula as
  generally in Henry's favour; and he said that he could have secured an
  all but universal consent, except for the secret intrigues of the Spanish
  agents, and their open direct menaces, when intrigue was insufficient. He
  complained bitterly of the treachery of the Italians who were in <!--
  Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span>
  the English pay; the two Cassalis, Pallavicino, and Ghinucci, the Bishop
  of Worcester. These men, he said, were betraying Henry when they were
  pretending to serve him, and were playing secretly into the hands of the
  emperor.<a name="NtA_265"></a><a href="#Nt_265"><sup>265</sup></a> His
  private despatches were intercepted, or the contents of them by some
  means were discovered; for the persons whom he named as inclining against
  the papal claims, became marked at once for persecution. One of them, a
  Carmelite friar, was summoned before the Cardinal Governor of Bologna,
  and threatened with death;<a name="NtA_266"></a><a
  href="#Nt_266"><sup>266</sup></a> and a certain Father Omnibow, a
  Venetian who had been in active co-operation with Dr. Croke, wrote
  himself to Henry, informing him in a very graphic manner of the treatment
  to which, by some treachery, he had been exposed. Croke and Omnibow were
  sitting one morning in the latter's cell, "when there entered upon them
  the emperor's great ambassador, accompanied with many gentlemen of Spain,
  and demanded of the Father how he durst be so bold to take upon him to
  intermeddle in so great and weighty a matter, the which did not only
  lessen and enervate the pope's authority, but was noyful and odious to
  all Realms Christened."<a name="NtA_267"></a><a
  href="#Nt_267"><sup>267</sup></a> Omnibow being a man of some influence
  in Venice, the ambassador warned him on peril of his life to deal no
  further with such things: there was not the slightest chance that the
  King of England could obtain a decision in his favour, because the
  question had been placed in the hands of six cardinals who were all
  devoted to the emperor: the pope, it was sternly added, had been made
  aware of his conduct, and was exceedingly displeased, and the general<a
  name="NtA_268"></a><a href="#Nt_268"><sup>268</sup></a> of his order had
  at the same time issued an injunction, warning all members to desist at
  their peril from intercourse with the English agents. The Spanish party
  held themselves justified in resorting to intimidation to defend
  themselves against English money; the English may have excused their use
  of money as a defence against Spanish intimidation; and each probably had
  recourse to their several methods prior to experience of the proceedings
  of their adversaries, from a certain expectation of what those
  proceedings would be. Substantially, the opposite man&#339;uvres
  neutralised each other, and in Catholic countries, opinions on the real
  point <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>[pg
  164]</span> at issue seem to have been equally balanced. The Lutheran
  divines, from their old suspicion of Henry, were more decided in their
  opposition to him. "The Italian Protestants," wrote Croke to the king,
  "be utterly against your Highness in this cause, and have letted as much
  as with their power and malice they could or might."<a
  name="NtA_269"></a><a href="#Nt_269"><sup>269</sup></a> In Germany Dr.
  Bames and Cranmer found the same experience. Luther himself had not
  forgotten his early passage at arms with the English Defender of the
  Faith, and was coldly hostile; the German theologians, although they
  expressed themselves with reserve and caution, saw no reason to court the
  anger of Charles by meddling in a quarrel in which they had no interest;
  they revenged the studied slight which had been passed by Henry on
  themselves, with a pardonable indifference to the English ecclesiastical
  revolt.</p>

  <p>If, however, in Germany and Italy the balance of unjust interference
  lay on the imperial side, it was more than adequately compensated by the
  answering pressure which was brought to bear in England and in France on
  the opposite side. Under the allied sovereigns, the royal authority was
  openly exercised to compel such expressions of sentiment as the courts of
  London and Paris desired; and the measures which were taken oblige us
  more than ever to regret the inventive efforts of Cranmer's genius. For,
  in fact, these man&#339;uvres, even if honestly executed, were all
  unrealities. The question at issue was one of domestic English politics,
  and the metamorphosis of it into a question of ecclesiastical law was a
  mere delusion. The discussion was transferred to a false ground, and
  however the king may have chosen to deceive himself, was not being tried
  upon its real merits. A complicated difficulty vitally affecting the
  interests of a great nation, was laid for solution before a body of
  persons incompetent to understand or decide it, and the laity, with the
  alternative before them of civil war, and the returning miseries of the
  preceding century, could brook no judgment which did not answer to their
  wishes.</p>

  <p>The French king, contemptuously indifferent to justice, submitted to
  be guided by his interest; feeling it necessary for his safety to fan the
  quarrel between Henry and the emperor, he resolved to encourage whatever
  measures would make the <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span> breach between them irreparable. The
  reconciliation of Herod and Pontius Pilate<a name="NtA_270"></a><a
  href="#Nt_270"><sup>270</sup></a> was the subject of his worst alarm; and
  a slight exercise of ecclesiastical tyranny was but a moderate price by
  which to ensure himself against so dangerous a possibility.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, at the beginning of June, the University of Paris was
  instructed by royal letters to pronounce an opinion on the extent to
  which the pope might grant dispensations for marriage within the
  forbidden degrees. The letters were presented by the grand master, and
  the latter in his address to the faculty, maintained at the outset an
  appearance of impartiality. The doctors were required to decide according
  to their conscience, having the fear of God before their eyes; and no
  open effort was ventured to dictate the judgment which was to be
  delivered.</p>

  <p>The majority of the doctors understood their duty and their position,
  and a speedy resolution was anticipated, when a certain Dr. Beda, an
  energetic Ultramontane, commenced an opposition. He said that, on a
  question which touched the power of the pope, they were not at liberty to
  pronounce an opinion without the permission of his Holiness himself; and
  that the deliberation ought not to go forward till they had applied for
  that permission and had received it. This view was supported by the
  Spanish and Italian party in the university. The debate grew warm, and at
  length the meeting broke up in confusion without coming to a resolution.
  Beda, when remonstrated with on the course which he was pursuing, did not
  hesitate to say that he had the secret approbation of his prince; that,
  however Francis might disguise from the world his real opinions, in his
  heart he only desired to see the pope victorious. An assertion so
  confident was readily believed, nor is it likely that Beda ventured to
  make it without some foundation. But being spoken of openly it became a
  matter of general conversation, and reaching the ears of the English
  ambassador, it was met with instant and angry remonstrance. "The
  ambassador," wrote the grand master to Francis, "has been to me in great
  displeasure, and has told me roundly that his master is trifled with by
  us. We give him words in plenty to keep his beak in the water; but it is
  very plain that we are playing false, and that no honesty is intended.
  Nor are his <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span> words altogether without reason; for
  many persons declare openly that nothing will be done. If the alliance of
  England, therefore, appear of importance to your Highness, it would be
  well for you to write to the Dean of the Faculty, directing him to close
  an impertinent discussion, and require an answer to the question asked as
  quickly as possible."<a name="NtA_271"></a><a
  href="#Nt_271"><sup>271</sup></a> The tone of this letter proves, with
  sufficient clearness, the true feelings of the French government; but at
  the moment the alternative suggested by the grand master might not be
  ventured. Francis could not afford to quarrel with England, or to be on
  less than cordial terms with it, and for a time at least his brother
  sovereigns must continue to be at enmity. The negotiations for the
  recovery of the French princes out of their Spanish prison, were on the
  point of conclusion; and, as Francis was insolvent, Henry had consented
  to become security for the money demanded for their deliverance. Beda
  had, moreover, injured his cause by attacking the Gallican liberties; and
  as this was a point on which the government was naturally sensitive, some
  tolerable excuse was furnished for the lesson which it was thought proper
  to adminster to the offending doctor.</p>

  <p>On the seventeenth of June, 1530, therefore, Francis wrote as follows
  to the President of the Parliament of Paris:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We have learnt, to our great displeasure, that one Beda, an
  imperialist, has dared to raise an agitation among the theologians,
  dissuading them from giving their voices on the cause of the King of
  England.&mdash;On receipt of this letter, therefore, you shall cause the
  said Beda to appear before you, and you shall show him the grievous anger
  which he has given us cause to entertain towards him. And further you
  shall declare to him, laying these our present writings before his eyes
  that he may not doubt the truth of what you say, that if he does not
  instantly repair the fault which he has committed, he shall be punished
  in such sort as that he shall remember henceforth what it is for a person
  of his quality to meddle in the affairs of princes. If he venture to
  remonstrate; if he allege that it is matter of conscience, and that
  before proceeding to pronounce an opinion it is necessary to communicate
  with the pope; in our name you shall forbid him to hold any such
  communication: and he and all who abet him, and all persons whatsoever,
  not only who shall themselves dare to consult the pope on this matter,
  but who shall so much as entertain the proposal of consulting him, shall
  be dealt with in such a manner as shall be an <!-- Page 167 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span> example to all the
  world. The liberties of the Gallican Church are touched, and the
  independence of our theological council, and there is no privilege
  belonging to this realm on which we are more peremptorily determined to
  insist."<a name="NtA_272"></a><a href="#Nt_272"><sup>272</sup></a></p>

  <p>The haughty missive, a copy of which was sent to England,<a
  name="NtA_273"></a><a href="#Nt_273"><sup>273</sup></a> produced the
  desired effect. The doctors became obedient and convinced, and the
  required declaration of opinion in Henry's favour, was drawn up in the
  most ample manner. They made a last desperate effort to escape from the
  position in which they were placed when the seal of the university was to
  be affixed to the decision; but the resistance was hopeless, the
  authorities were inexorable, and they submitted. It is not a little
  singular that the English political agent employed on this occasion, and
  to whose lot it fell to communicate the result to the king, was Reginald
  Pole. He it was, who behind the scenes, and assisting to work the
  machinery of the intrigue, first there, perhaps, contracted his disgust
  with the cause on which he was embarked. There learning to hate the ill
  with which he was forced immediately into contact, he lost sight of the
  greater ill to which it was opposed; and in the recoil commenced the
  first steps of a career, which brought his mother to the scaffold, which
  overspread all England with an atmosphere of treason and suspicion, and
  which terminated at last after years of exile, rebellion, and falsehood,
  in a brief victory of blood and shame. So ever does wrong action beget
  its own retribution, punishing itself by itself, and wrecking the
  instruments by which it works. The letter which Pole wrote from Paris to
  Henry will not be uninteresting. It revealed his distaste for his
  occupation, though prudence held him silent as to his deeper
  feelings.</p>

  <p>"Please it your Highness to be advertised, that the determination and
  conclusion of the divines in this university was achieved and finished
  according to your desired purpose, upon Saturday last past. The sealing
  of the same has been put off unto this day, nor never could be obtained
  before for any soliciting on our parts which were your agents here, which
  never ceased to labour, all that lay in us, for the expedition of it,
  both with the privy president and with all such as we thought might in
  any part aid us therein. But what difficulties and stops hath been, to
  let the obtaining of the seal of the university, notwithstanding the
  conclusion passed and agreed unto by the more part of the <!-- Page 168

  by reason of such oppositions as the adversary part hath made to embezzle
  the determination that it should not take effect nor go forth in that

  exercise in the cause, hath most holp to resist all these crafts, and to
  bring the matter to that point as your most desired purpose hath been to
  have it. He hath indeed acted according to that hope which I had of him
  at the beginning and first breaking of the matter amongst the faculty
  here, when I, somewhat fearing and foreseeing such contentions,
  altercations, and empeschements as by most likelihood might ensue, did
  give your Grace advertisement, how necessary I thought it was to have
  Master Fox's presence. And whereas I was informed by Master Fox how it
  standeth with your Grace's pleasure, considering my fervent desire
  thereon, that, your motion once achieved and brought to a final
  conclusion in this university, I should repair to your presence, your
  Grace could not grant me at this time a petition more comfortable unto
  me. And so, making what convenient speed I may, my trust is shortly to
  wait upon your Highness. Thus Jesu preserve your most noble Grace to his
  pleasure, and your most comfort and honour. Written at Paris, the seventh
  day of July, by your Grace's most humble and faithful servant, REGINALD
  POLE."<a name="NtA_274"></a><a href="#Nt_274"><sup>274</sup></a></p>

  <p>We must speak of this transaction as it deserves, and call it wholly
  bad, unjust, and inexcusable. Yet we need not deceive ourselves into
  supposing that the opposition which was crushed so roughly was based on
  any principal of real honesty. In Italy, intrigue was used against
  intimidation. In France intimidation was used against intrigue; and the
  absence of rectitude in the parties whom it was necessary to influence,
  provoked and justified the contempt with which they were treated.</p>

  <p>The conduct of the English universities on the same occasion was
  precisely what their later characters would have led us respectively to
  expect from them. At Oxford the heads of houses and the senior doctors
  and masters submitted their consciences to state dictation, without
  opposition, and, as it seemed, without reluctance. Henry was wholly
  satisfied that the right was on his own side; he was so convinced of it,
  that an opposition to his wishes among his own subjects, he could
  attribute only to disloyalty or to some other unworthy feeling; <!-- Page
  169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span> and
  therefore, while he directed the convocation, "giving no credence to
  sinister persuasions, to show and declare their just and true learning in
  his cause," he was able to dwell upon the answer which he expected from
  them, as a plain matter of duty; and obviously as not admitting of any
  uncertainty whatever.</p>

  <p>"We will and command you," he said, "that ye, not leaning to wilful
  and sinister opinions of your own several minds, considering that we be
  your sovereign liege lord [and] totally giving your time, mind, and
  affections to the true overtures of divine learning in this behalf, do
  show and declare your true and just learning in the said cause, like as
  ye will abide by: wherein ye shall not only please Almighty God, but also
  us your liege lord. And we, for your so doing, shall be to you and to our
  university there so good and gracious a lord for the same, as ye shall
  perceive it well done in your well fortune to come. And in case you do
  not uprightly, according to divine learning, handle yourselves herein, ye
  may be assured that we, not without great cause, shall so quickly and
  sharply look to your unnatural misdemeanour herein, that it shall not be
  to your quietness and ease hereafter."<a name="NtA_275"></a><a
  href="#Nt_275"><sup>275</sup></a> The admonitory clauses were
  sufficiently clear; they were scarcely needed, however, by the older
  members of the university. An enlarged experience of the world which
  years, at Oxford as well as elsewhere, had not failed to bring with them,
  a just apprehension of the condition of the kingdom, and a sense of the
  obligations of subjects in times of political difficulty, sufficed to
  reconcile the heads of the colleges to obedience; and threats were not
  required where it is unlikely that a thought of hesitation was
  entertained. But there was a class of residents which appears to be
  perennial in that university, composed out of the younger masters; a
  class of men who, defective alike in age, in wisdom, or in knowledge,
  were distinguished by a species of theoretic High Church fanaticism; who,
  until they received their natural correction from advancing years,
  required from time to time to be protected against their own extravagance
  by some form of external pressure. These were the persons whom the king
  was addressing in his more severe language, and it was not without reason
  that he had recourse to it.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid difficulty, and to secure a swift and convenient
  resolution, it was proposed that both at Oxford and Cambridge the
  universities should be represented by a committee composed of the heads
  of houses, the proctors, and the <!-- Page 170 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span> graduates in
  divinity and law: that this committee should agree upon a form of a
  reply; and that the university seal should then be affixed without
  further discussion. This proposition was plausible as well as prudent,
  for it might be supposed reasonably that young half-educated students
  were incapable of forming a judgment on an intricate point of law; and to
  admit their votes was equivalent to allowing judgment to be given by
  party feeling. The masters who were to be thus excluded refused however
  to entertain this view of their incapacity. The question whether the
  committee should be appointed was referred to convocation, where, having
  the advantage of numbers, they coerced the entire proceedings; and some
  of them "expressing themselves in a very forward manner" to the royal
  commissioners,<a name="NtA_276"></a><a href="#Nt_276"><sup>276</sup></a>
  and the heads of houses being embarrassed, and not well knowing what to
  do, the king found it necessary again to interpose. He was unwilling, as
  he said, to violate the constitution of the university by open
  interference, "considering it to exist under grant and charter from the
  crown as a body politic, in the ruling whereof in things to be done in
  the name of the whole, the number of private suffrages doth prevail." "He
  was loth, too," he added, "to show his displeasure, whereof he had so
  great cause ministered unto him, unto the whole in general, whereas the
  fault perchance consisted and remained in light and wilful heads," and he
  trusted that it might suffice if the masters of the colleges used their
  private influence and authority<a name="NtA_277"></a><a
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>277</sup></a> in overcoming the opposition. For the
  effecting of this purpose, however, and in order to lend weight to their
  persuasion, he assisted the convocation towards a conclusion with the
  following characteristic missive:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To our trusty and well-beloved the heads of houses, doctors, and
  proctors of our University of Oxford:</p>

  <p>"Trusty and well-beloved, we greet you well; and of late being
  informed, to our no little marvel and discontentation, that a great part
  of the youth of that our university, with contentious and factious manner
  daily combining together, neither regarding their duty to us their
  sovereign lord, nor yet conforming themselves to the opinions and orders
  of the virtuous, wise, sage, and profound learned men of that university,
  wilfully do stick upon the opinion to have a great number of regents and
  non-regents to be associate unto the doctors, proctors, and bachelors of
  divinity for the determination of our question; which we <!-- Page 171
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span> believe
  hath not been often seen, that such a number of right small learning in
  regard to the other should be joined with so famous a sort, or in a
  manner stay their seniors in so weighty a cause. And forasmuch as this,
  we think, should be no small dishonour to our university there, but most
  especially to you the seniors and rulers of the same; and as also, we
  assure you, this their unnatural and unkind demeanour is not only right
  much to our displeasure, but much to be marvelled of, upon what ground
  and occasion, they being our mere subjects, should show themselves more
  unkind and wilful in this matter than all other universities, both in
  this and all other regions do: we, trusting in the dexterity and wisdom
  of you and other the said discreet and substantial learned men of that
  university, be in perfect hope that ye will conduce and frame the said
  young persons unto order and conformity as it becometh you to do. Whereof
  we be desirous to hear with incontinent diligence; and doubt you not we
  shall regard the demeanour of every one of the university according to
  their merits and deserts. And if the youth of the university will play
  masteries as they begin to do, we doubt not but they shall well perceive
  that non est bonum irritare crabrones.<a name="NtA_278"></a><a

  <p>"Given under our hand and seal, at our Castle of Windsor,</p>

  <p>"HENRY R."<a name="NtA_279"></a><a
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>279</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary to say, that, armed with this letter, the
  heads of houses subdued the recalcitrance of the overhasty "youth;" and
  Oxford duly answered as she was required to answer.</p>

  <p>The proceedings at Cambridge were not very dissimilar; but Cambridge
  being distinguished by greater openness and largeness of mind on this as
  on the other momentous subjects of the day than the sister university,
  was able to preserve a more manly bearing, and escape direct humiliation.
  Cranmer had written a book upon the divorce in the preceding year, which,
  as coming from a well-known Cambridge man, had occasioned a careful
  ventilation of the question there; the resident masters had been divided
  by it into factions nearly equal in number, though unharmoniously
  composed. The heads of houses, as at Oxford, were inclined to the king,
  but they were embarrassed and divided by the presence on the same side of
  the suspected liberals, the party of Shaxton, Latimer, and Cranmer
  himself. <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>[pg
  172]</span> The agitation of many months had rendered all members of the
  university, young and old, so well acquainted (as they supposed) with the
  bearings of the difficulty, that they naturally resisted, as at the other
  university, the demand that their power should be delegated to a
  committee; and the Cambridge convocation, as well as that of Oxford,
  threw out this resolution when it was first proposed to them. A king's
  letter having made them more amenable, a list of the intended committee
  was drawn out, which, containing Latimer's name, occasioned a fresh
  storm. But the number in the senate house being nearly divided, "the
  labour of certain friends" turned the scale; the vote passed, and the
  committee was allowed, on condition that the question should be argued
  publicly in the presence of the whole university. Finally, judgment was
  obtained on the king's side, though in a less absolute form than he had
  required, and the commissioners did not think it prudent to press for a
  more extreme conclusion. They had been desired to pronounce that the pope
  had no power to permit a man to marry his brother's widow. They consented
  only to say that a marriage within those degrees was contrary to the
  divine law; but the question of the pope's power was left unapproached.<a
  name="NtA_280"></a><a href="#Nt_280"><sup>280</sup></a></p>

  <p>It will not be uninteresting to follow this judgment a further step,
  to the delivery of it into the hands of the king, where it will introduce
  us to a Sunday at Windsor Castle three centuries ago. We shall find
  present there, as a significant symptom of the time, Hugh Latimer,
  appointed freshly select preacher in the royal chapel, but already
  obnoxious to English orthodoxy, on account of his Cambridge sermons.
  These sermons, it had been said, contained many things good and
  profitable, "on sin, and godliness, and virtue," but much also which was
  disrespectful to established beliefs, the preacher being clearly opposed
  to "candles and pilgrimages," and "calling men unto the works that God
  commanded in his Holy Scripture, all dreams and unprofitable glosses set
  aside and utterly despised." The preacher had, therefore, been cited
  before consistory courts and interdicted by bishops, "swarms of friars
  and doctors flocking against Master Latimer on every side."<a
  name="NtA_281"></a><a href="#Nt_281"><sup>281</sup></a> This also was to
  be noted about him, that he was one of the most fearless men who ever
  lived. Like John Knox, whom he much resembled, in whatever presence he
  might be, whether of poor or rich, of laymen or priests, of bishops or
  kings, he ever spoke out boldly <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span> from his pulpit what he thought,
  directly if necessary to particular persons whom he saw before him
  respecting their own actions. Even Henry himself he did not spare where
  he saw occasion for blame; and Henry, of whom it was said that he never
  was mistaken in a <i>man</i>&mdash;loving a <i>man</i><a
  name="NtA_282"></a><a href="#Nt_282"><sup>282</sup></a> where he could
  find him with all his heart&mdash;had, notwithstanding, chosen this
  Latimer as one of his own chaplains.</p>

  <p>The unwilling bearer of the Cambridge judgment was Dr. Buckmaster, the
  vice-chancellor, who, in a letter to a friend, describes his reception at
  the royal castle.</p>

  <p>"To the right worshipful Dr. Edmonds, vicar of Alborne, in Wiltshire,
  my duty remembered,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I heartily commend me unto you, and I let you understand that
  yesterday week, being Sunday at afternoon, I came to Windsor, and also to
  part of Mr. Latimer's sermon; and after the end of the same I spake with
  Mr. Secretary [Cromwell], and also with Mr. Provost; and so after
  evensong I delivered our letters in the Chamber of Presence, all the
  court beholding. The king, with Mr. Secretary, did there read them; and
  did then give me thanks and talked with me a good while. He much lauded
  our wisdom and good conveyance in the matter, with the great quietness in
  the same. He showed me also what he had in his hands for our university,
  according to that which Mr. Secretary did express unto us, and so he
  departed from me. But by and bye he greatly praised Mr. Latimer's sermon;
  and in so praising said on this wise: 'This displeaseth greatly Mr.
  Vice-Chancellor yonder; yon same,' said he to the Duke of Norfolk, 'is
  Mr. Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge,' and so pointed unto me. Then he spake
  secretly unto the said duke, which, after the king's departure, came unto
  me and welcomed me, saying, among other things, the king would speak with
  me on the next day. And here is the first act. On the next day I waited
  until it was dinner time; and so at the last Dr. Butts, [king's
  physician,] came unto me, and brought a reward, twenty nobles for me, and
  five marks for the junior proctor which was with me, saying that I should
  take that for a resolute answer, and that I might depart from the court
  when I would. Then came Mr. Provost, and when I had shewed him of the
  answer, he said I should speak with the king after dinner for all that,
  and so he brought me into a privy place where after dinner he <!-- Page
  174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span> would
  have me wait. I came thither and he both; and by one of the clock the
  king entered in. It was in a gallery. There were Mr. Secretary, Mr.
  Provost, Mr. Latimer, Mr. Proctor, and I, and no more. The king then
  talked with us until six of the clock. I assure you he was scarce
  contented with Mr. Secretary and Mr. Provost, that this was not also
  determined, <i>an Papa possit dispensare</i>. I made the best, and
  confirmed the same that they had shewed his Grace before; and how it
  would never have been so obtained. He opened his mind, saying he would
  have it determined after Easter, and of the same was counselled
  awhile.</p>

  <p>"Much other communication we had, which were too long here to recite.
  Then his Highness departed, casting a little holy water of the court; and
  I shortly after took my leave of Mr. Secretary and Mr. Provost, with whom
  I did not drink, nor yet was bidden, and on the morrow departed from
  thence, thinking more than I did say, and being glad that I was out of
  the court, where many men, as I did both hear and perceive, did wonder at
  me. And here shall be an end for this time of this fable.</p>

  <p>"All the world almost crieth out of Cambridge for this act, and
  specially on me; but I must bear it as well as I may. I have lost a
  benefice by it, which I should have had within these ten days; for there
  hath one fallen in Mr. Throgmorton's<a name="NtA_283"></a><a
  href="#Nt_283"><sup>283</sup></a> gift which he hath faithfully promised
  unto me many a time, but now his mind is turned and alienate from me. If
  ye go to court after Easter I pray you have me in remembrance. Mr.
  Latimer preacheth still,&mdash;quod æmuli ejus graviter ferunt.</p>

  <p>"Thus fare you well. Your own to his power,<br />
  WILLIAM BUCKMASTER.<a name="NtA_284"></a><a
  href="#Nt_284"><sup>284</sup></a><br />
  Cambridge, Monday after Easter, 1530."</p>

  <p>It does not appear that Cambridge was pressed further, and we may,
  therefore, allow it to have acquitted itself creditably, If we sum up the
  results of Cranmer's measure as a whole, it may be said that opinions had
  been given by about half Europe directly or indirectly unfavourable to
  the papal claims; and that, therefore, the king had furnished himself
  with a legal pretext for declining the jurisdiction of the court of Rome,
  and appealing to a general council. Objections to the manner in <!-- Page
  175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span> which
  the opinions had been gained could be answered by recriminations equally
  just; and in the technical aspect of the question a step had certainly
  been gained. It will be thought, nevertheless, on wider grounds, that the
  measure was a mistake; that it would have been far better if the legal
  labyrinth had never been entered, and if the divorce had been claimed
  only upon those considerations of policy for which it had been first
  demanded, and which formed the true justification of it. Not only might a
  shameful chapter of scandal have been spared out of the world's history,
  but the point on which the battle was being fought lay beside the real
  issue. Europe was shaken with intrigue, hundreds of books were written,
  and tens of thousands of tongues were busy for twelve months weaving
  logical subtleties, and all for nothing. The truth was left unspoken
  because it was not convenient to speak it, and all parties agreed to
  persuade themselves and accept one another's persuasions, that they meant
  something which they did not mean. Beyond doubt the theological
  difficulty really affected the king. We cannot read his own book<a
  name="NtA_285"></a><a href="#Nt_285"><sup>285</sup></a> upon it without a
  conviction that his arguments were honestly urged, that his misgivings
  were real, and that he meant every word which he said. Yet it is clear at
  the same time that these misgivings would not have been satisfied, if all
  the wisdom of the world&mdash;pope, cardinals, councils, and all the
  learned faculties together&mdash;had declared against him, the true
  secret of the matter lying deeper, understood and appreciated by all the
  chief parties concerned, and by the English laity, whose interests were
  at stake; but in all these barren disputings ignored as if it had no
  existence.</p>

  <p>It was perhaps less easy than it seems to have followed the main road.
  The bye ways often promise best at first entrance into them, and Henry's
  peculiar temper never allowed him to believe beforehand that a track
  which he had chosen could lead to any conclusion except that to which he
  had arranged that it should lead. With an intellect endlessly fertile in
  finding reasons to justify what he desired, he could see no justice on
  any side but his own, or understand that it was possible to disagree with
  him except from folly of ill-feeling. Starting always with a foregone
  conclusion, he arrived of course where he wished to arrive. His "Glasse
  of Truth" is a very picture of his mind. "If the marshall of the host
  bids us do anything," he said, "shall we do it if it be against the great
  captain? Again, if the great captain bid us do anything, and the king or
  the emperor commandeth <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span> us to do another, dost thou doubt that
  we must obey the commandment of the king or emperor, and contemn the
  commandment of the great captain? Therefore if the king or the emperor
  bid one thing, and God another, we must obey God, and contemn and not
  regard neither king nor emperor." And, therefore, he argued, "we are not
  to obey the pope, when the pope commands what is unlawful."<a
  name="NtA_286"></a><a href="#Nt_286"><sup>286</sup></a> These were but
  many words to prove what the pope would not have questioned; and either
  they concluded nothing or the conclusion was assumed.</p>

  <p>We cannot but think that among the many misfortunes of Henry's life
  his theological training was the greatest; and that directly or
  indirectly it was the parent of all the rest. If in this unhappy business
  he had trusted only to his instincts as an English statesman; if he had
  been contented himself with the truth, and had pressed no arguments
  except those which in the secrets of his heart had weight with him, he
  would have spared his own memory a mountain of undeserved reproach, and
  have spared historians their weary labour through these barren deserts of
  unreality.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>CHURCH AND STATE</h3>

  <p>The authorities of the church, after the lesson which they had
  received from the parliament in its first session, were now allowed a
  respite of two years, during which they might reconsider the complaints
  of the people, and consult among themselves upon the conduct which they
  would pursue with respect to those complaints. They availed themselves of
  their interval of repose in a manner little calculated to recover the
  esteem which they had forfeited, or to induce the legislature further to
  stay their hand. Instead of reforming their own faults, they spent the
  time in making use of their yet uncurtailed powers of persecution; and
  they wreaked the bitterness of their resentment upon the unfortunate
  heretics, who paid with their blood at the stake for the diminished
  revenues and blighted dignities of their spiritual lords and superiors.
  During the later years of Wolsey's administration, the Protestants,
  though threatened <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span> and imprisoned, had escaped the most
  cruel consequences of their faith. Wolsey had been a warm-hearted and
  genuine man, and although he had believed as earnestly as his brother
  bishops, that Protestantism was a pernicious thing, destructive alike to
  the institutions of the country and to the souls of mankind, his memory
  can be reproached with nothing worse than assiduous but humane efforts
  for the repression of it. In the three years which followed his
  dismissal, a far more bloody page was written in the history of the
  reformers; and under the combined auspices of Sir Thomas More's
  fanaticism, and the spleen of the angry clergy, the stake re-commenced
  its hateful activity. This portion of my subject requires a full and
  detailed treatment; I reserve the account of it, therefore, for a
  separate chapter, and proceed for the present with the progress of the
  secular changes.</p>

  <p>Although, as I said, no further legislative measures were immediately
  contemplated against the clergy, yet they were not permitted to forget
  the alteration in their position which had followed upon Wolsey's fall;
  and as they had shown in the unfortunate document which they had
  submitted to the king, so great a difficulty in comprehending the nature
  of that alteration, it was necessary clearly and distinctly to enforce it
  upon them. Until that moment they had virtually held the supreme power in
  the state. The nobility, crippled by the wars of the Roses, had sunk into
  the second place; the Commons were disorganised, or incapable of a
  definite policy; and the chief offices of the government had fallen as a
  matter of course to the only persons who for the moment were competent to
  hold them. The jealousy of ecclesiastical encroachments, which had shown
  itself so bitterly under the Plantagenets, had been superseded from the
  accession of Henry VII. by a policy of studied conciliation, and the
  position of Wolsey had but symbolised the position of his order. But
  Wolsey was now gone, and the ecclesiastics who had shared his greatness
  while they envied it, were compelled to participate also in his change of
  fortune.</p>

  <p>This great minister, after the failure of a discreditable effort to
  fasten upon him a charge of high treason,&mdash;a charge which,
  vindictively pressed through the House of Lords, was wisely rejected by
  the Commons,&mdash;had been prosecuted with greater justice for a breach
  of the law, in having exercised the authority of papal legate within the
  realm of England. His policy had broken down: he had united against him
  in a common exasperation all orders in the state, secular and spiritual;
  and the possible consequences of his adventurous transgression had fallen
  <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>[pg
  178]</span> upon him. The parliaments of Edward I., Edward III., Richard
  II., and Henry IV. had by a series of statutes pronounced illegal all
  presentations by the pope to any office or dignity in the Anglican
  church, under penalty of a premunire; the provisions of these acts
  extending not only to the persons themselves who accepted office under
  such conditions, but comprehending equally whoever acknowledged their
  authority, "their executors, procurators, fautors, maintainers, and
  receivers."<a name="NtA_287"></a><a href="#Nt_287"><sup>287</sup></a> The
  importance attached to these laws was to be seen readily in the frequent
  re-enactment of them, with language of increasing vehemence; and although
  the primary object was to neutralise the supposed right of the pope to
  present to English benefices, and although the office of papal legate is
  not especially named in any one of the prohibitory clauses, yet so acute
  a canonist as Wolsey could not have been ignorant that it was
  comprehended under the general denunciation. The 5th of the 16th of
  Richard II. was in fact explicitly universal in its language, and dwelt
  especially on the importance of prohibiting the exercise of any species
  of jurisdiction which could encroach on the royal authority. He had
  therefore consciously violated a law on his own responsibility, which he
  knew to exist, but which he perhaps trusted had fallen into desuetude,
  and would not again be revived. It cannot be denied that in doing so,
  being at the time the highest law officer of the crown, he had committed
  a grave offence, and was justly liable to the full penalties of the
  broken statute. He had received the royal permission, but it was a plea
  which could not have availed him, and he did not attempt to urge it.<a
  name="NtA_288"></a><a href="#Nt_288"><sup>288</sup></a> The contingency
  of a possible violation of <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span> the law by the king himself had been
  expressly foreseen and provided against in the act under which he was
  prosecuted,<a name="NtA_289"></a><a href="#Nt_289"><sup>289</sup></a> and
  being himself the king's legal adviser, it was his duty to have kept his
  sovereign<a name="NtA_290"></a><a href="#Nt_290"><sup>290</sup></a>
  informed of the true nature of the statute. He had neglected this, his
  immediate obligation, in pursuit of the interests of the church, and when
  Henry's eyes were opened, he did not consider himself called upon to
  interfere to shield his minister from the penalties which he had
  incurred, nor is it likely that in the face of the irritation of the
  country he could have done so if he had desired. It was felt, indeed,
  that the long services of Wolsey, and his generally admirable
  administration, might fairly save him (especially under the circumstances
  of the case) from extremity of punishment; and if he had been allowed to
  remain unmolested in the affluent retirement which was at first conceded
  to him, his treatment would not have <!-- Page 180 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span> caused the stain
  which we have now to lament on the conduct of the administration which
  succeeded his fall. He indeed himself believed that the final attack upon
  him was due to no influence of rival statesmen, but to the hatred of Anne
  Boleyn; and perhaps he was not mistaken. This, however, is a matter which
  does not concern us here, and I need not pursue it. It is enough that he
  had violated the law of England, openly and knowingly, and on the revival
  of the national policy by which that law had been enacted, he reaped the
  consequences in his own person.</p>

  <p>It will be a question whether we can equally approve of the enlarged
  application of the statute which immediately followed. The guilt of
  Wolsey did not rest with himself; it extended to all who had recognised
  him in his capacity of legate; to the archbishops and bishops, to the two
  Houses of Convocation, to the Privy Council, to the Lords and Commons,
  and indirectly to the nation itself. It was obvious that such a state of
  things was not contemplated by the act under which he was tried, and
  where in point of law all persons were equally guilty, in equity they
  were equally innocent; the circumstances of the case, therefore, rendered
  necessary a general pardon, which was immediately drawn out. The
  government, however, while granting absolution to the nation, determined
  to make some exceptions in their lenity; and harsh as their resolution
  appeared, it is not difficult to conjecture the reasons which induced
  them to form it. The higher clergy had been encouraged by Wolsey's
  position to commit those excessive acts of despotism which had created so
  deep animosity among the people. The overthrow of the last ecclesiastical
  minister was an opportunity to teach them that the privileges which they
  had abused were at an end; and as the lesson was so difficult for them to
  learn, the letter of the law which they had broken was put in force to
  quicken their perceptions. They were to be punished indirectly for their
  other evil doings, and forced to surrender some portion of the unnumbered
  exactions which they had extorted from the helplessness of their
  flocks.</p>

  <p>In pursuance of this resolution, therefore, official notice was issued
  in December, 1530, that the clergy lay all under a premunire, and that
  the crown intended to prosecute. Convocation was to meet in the middle of
  January, and this comforting fact was communicated to the bishops in
  order to divert their attention to subjects which might profitably occupy
  their deliberations. The church legislature had sate in the preceding
  years contemporaneously with the sitting of parliament, at the <!-- Page
  181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span> time
  when their privileges were being discussed, and when their conduct had
  been so angrily challenged: but these matters had not disturbed their
  placid equanimity: and while the bishops were composing their answer to
  the House of Commons, Convocation had been engaged in debating the most
  promising means of persecuting heretics and preventing the circulation of
  the Bible.<a name="NtA_291"></a><a href="#Nt_291"><sup>291</sup></a> The
  session had continued into the spring of 1529-30, when the king had been
  prevailed upon to grant an order in council prohibiting Tyndale's
  Testament, in the preface of which the clergy were spoken of
  disrespectfully.<a name="NtA_292"></a><a
  href="#Nt_292"><sup>292</sup></a> His consent had been obtained with
  great difficulty, on the representation of the bishops that the
  translation was faulty, and on their undertaking themselves to supply the
  place of it with a corrected version. But in obtaining the order, they
  supposed themselves to have gained a victory; and their triumph was
  celebrated in St. Paul's churchyard with an auto da fé, over which the
  Bishop of London consented to preside; when such New Testaments as the
  diligence of the apparitors could discover, were solemnly burned.</p>

  <p>From occupation such as this a not unwholesome distraction was
  furnished by the intimation of the premunire; and that it might produce
  its due effect, it was accompanied with the further information that the
  clergy of the province of Canterbury would receive their pardon only upon
  payment of a hundred thousand pounds&mdash;a very considerable fine,
  amounting to more than a million of our money. Eighteen thousand pounds
  was required simultaneously from the province of York; and the whole sum
  was to be paid in instalments spread over a period of five years.<a
  name="NtA_293"></a><a href="#Nt_293"><sup>293</sup></a> The demand was
  serious, but the clergy had no alternative but to submit or to risk the
  chances of the law; and <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span> feeling that, with the people so
  unfavourably disposed towards them, they had no chance of a more
  equitable construction of their position, they consented with a tolerable
  grace, the Upper House of Convocation first, the Lower following. Their
  debates upon the subject have not been preserved. It was probably
  difficult to persuade them that they were treated with anything but the
  most exquisite injustice; since Wolsey's legatine faculties had been the
  object of their general dread; and if he had remained in power, the
  religious orders would have been exposed to a searching visitation in
  virtue of these faculties, from which they could have promised themselves
  but little advantage. But their punishment, if tyrannical in form, was
  equitable in substance, and we can reconcile ourselves without difficulty
  to an act of judicial confiscation.</p>

  <p>The money, however, was not the only concession which the threat of
  the premunire gave opportunity to extort; and it is creditable to the
  clergy that the demand which they showed most desire to resist was not
  that which most touched their personal interests. In the preamble of the
  subsidy bill, under which they were to levy their ransom, they were
  required by the council to designate the king by the famous title which
  gave occasion for such momentous consequences, of "Protector and only
  Supreme Head of the Church and Clergy of England."<a
  name="NtA_294"></a><a href="#Nt_294"><sup>294</sup></a> It is not very
  easy to see what Henry proposed to himself by requiring this designation,
  at so early a stage in the movement. The breach with the pope was still
  distant, and he was prepared to make many sacrifices before he would even
  seriously contemplate a step which he so little desired. It may have been
  designed as a reply to the papal censures: it may have been to give
  effect to his own menaces, which Clement to the last believed to be no
  more than words;<a name="NtA_295"></a><a
  href="#Nt_295"><sup>295</sup></a> or perhaps (and this is the most
  likely) he desired by some emphatic act, to make his clergy understand
  the relation in which thenceforward they were to be placed towards the
  temporal authority. It is certain only that this title was not intended
  to imply what it implied when, four years later, it was conferred by act
  Of parliament, and when virtually England was severed by it from the
  Roman communion.</p>

  <p>But whatever may have been the king's motive, he was serious in
  requiring that the title should be granted to him. Only by acknowledging
  Henry as Head of the Church should the clergy receive their pardon, and
  the longer they hesitated, the more peremptorily he insisted on their
  obedience. The clergy had <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span> defied the lion, and the lion held
  them in his grasp; and they could but struggle helplessly, supplicate and
  submit. Archbishop Warham, just drawing his life to a close, presided for
  the last time in the miserable scene, imagining that the clouds were
  gathering for the storms of the latter day, and that Antichrist was
  coming in his power.</p>

  <p>There had been a debate of three days, whether they should or should
  not consent, when, on the 9th of February, a deputation of the judges
  appeared in Convocation, to ask whether the Houses were agreed, and to
  inform them finally that the king had determined to allow no
  qualifications. The clergy begged for one more day, and the following
  morning the bishops held a private meeting among themselves, to discuss
  some plan to turn aside the blow. They desired to see Cromwell, to learn,
  perhaps, if there was a chance of melting the hard heart of Henry; and
  after an interview with the minister which could not have been
  encouraging, they sent two of their number, the Bishops of Exeter and
  Lincoln, to attempt the unpromising task. It was in vain; the miserable
  old men were obliged to return with the answer that the king would not
  see them&mdash;they had seen only the judges, who had assured them, in
  simple language, that the pardon was not to be settled until the
  supremacy was admitted. The answer was communicated to the House, and
  again "debated." Submission was against the consciences of the unhappy
  clergy; to obey their consciences involved forfeiture of property; and
  naturally in such a dilemma they found resolution difficult. They
  attempted another appeal, suggesting that eight of their number should
  hold a conference with the privy council, and "discover, if they might,
  some possible expedient." But Henry replied, as before, that he would
  have a clear answer, "<i>yes</i>, or <i>no</i>." They might say "yes,"
  and their pardon was ready. They might say "no"&mdash;and accept the
  premunire and its penalties. And now, what should the clergy have done?
  No very great courage was required to answer, "This thing is wrong; it is
  against God's will, and therefore it must not be, whether premunire come
  or do not come." They might have said it, and if they could have dared
  this little act of courage, victory was in their hands. With the cause
  against them so doubtful, their very attitude would have commanded back
  the sympathies of half the nation, and the king's threats would have
  exploded as an empty sound. But Henry knew the persons with whom he had
  to deal&mdash;forlorn shadows, decked in the trappings of <!-- Page 184
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span>
  dignity&mdash;who only by some such rough method could be brought to a
  knowledge of themselves. "Shrink to the clergy"&mdash;I find in a state
  paper of the time&mdash;"Shrink to the clergy, and they be lions; lay
  their faults roundly and charitably to them, and they be as sheep, and
  will lightly be reformed, for their consciences will not suffer them to
  resist."<a name="NtA_296"></a><a href="#Nt_296"><sup>296</sup></a></p>

  <p>They hesitated for another night. The day following, the archbishop
  submitted the clause containing the title to the Upper House, with a
  saving paragraph, which, as Burnet sententiously observes, the nature of
  things did require to be supposed.<a name="NtA_297"></a><a
  href="#Nt_297"><sup>297</sup></a> "Ecclesiæ et cleri Anglicani," so it
  ran, "singularem protectorem, et unicum et supremum Dominum, et quantum
  per legem Christi licet, etiam supremum caput ipsius Majestatem
  agnoscimus&mdash;We recognise the King's Majesty to be our only sovereign
  lord, the singular protector of the church and clergy of England, and as
  far as is allowed by the law of Christ, also as our Supreme Head." The
  words were read aloud by the archbishop, and were received in silence.
  "Do you assent?" he asked. The House remained speechless. "Whoever is
  silent seems to consent," the archbishop said. A voice answered out of
  the crowd, "Then are we all silent." They separated for a few hours to
  collect themselves. In the afternoon sitting they discussed the
  sufficiency of the subterfuge; and at length agreeing that it saved their
  consciences, the clause was finally passed, the Bishop of Rochester,
  among the rest, giving his unwilling acquiescence.</p>

  <p>So for the present terminated this grave matter. The pardon was
  immediately submitted to parliament, where it was embodied in a
  statute;<a name="NtA_298"></a><a href="#Nt_298"><sup>298</sup></a> and
  this act of dubious justice accomplished, the Convocation was allowed to
  return to its usual occupations, and continue the prosecutions of the
  heretics.</p>

  <p>The House of Commons, during their second session, had <!-- Page 185
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> confined
  themselves meanwhile to secular business. They had been concerned chiefly
  with regulations affecting trade and labour; and the proceedings on the
  premunire being thought for the time to press sufficiently on the clergy,
  they deferred the further prosecution of their own complaints till the
  following year. Two measures, however, highly characteristic of the age,
  must not be passed over, one of which concerned a matter that must have
  added heavily to the troubles of the Bishop of Rochester at a time when
  he was in no need of any addition to his burdens.</p>

  <p>Fisher was the only one among the prelates for whom it is possible to
  feel respect. He was weak, superstitious, pedantical; towards the
  Protestants he was even cruel; but he was a singlehearted man, who lived
  in honest fear of evil, so far as he understood what evil was; and he
  alone could rise above the menaces of worldly suffering, under which his
  brethren on the bench sank so rapidly into meekness and submission. We
  can therefore afford to compassionate him in the unexpected calamity by
  which he was overtaken, and which must have tried his failing spirit in
  no common manner.</p>

  <p>He lived, while his duties required his presence in London, at a house
  in Lambeth, and being a hospitable person, he opened his doors at the
  dinner hour for the poor of the neighbourhood. Shortly after the matter
  which I have just related, many of these people who were dependent on his
  bounty were reported to have become alarmingly ill, and several gentlemen
  of the household sickened also in the same sudden and startling manner.
  One of these gentlemen died, and a poor woman also died; and it was
  discovered on inquiry that the yeast which had been used in various
  dishes had been poisoned. The guilty person was the cook, a certain
  Richard Rouse; and inasmuch as all crimes might be presumed to have had
  motives, and the motive in the present instance was undiscoverable, it
  was conjectured by Queen Catherine's friends that he had been bribed by
  Anne Boleyn, or by some one of her party, to remove out of the way the
  most influential of the English opponents of the divorce.<a
  name="NtA_299"></a><a href="#Nt_299"><sup>299</sup></a> The story was
  possibly without foundation, although it is not unlikely that Fisher
  himself believed it. The shock of such an occurrence may well have
  unsettled his powers of reasoning, and at all times he was a person whose
  better judgment was easily harassed into incapacity. The origin of the
  crime, however, is of less importance than the effect of the discovery
  <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>[pg
  186]</span> upon the nation, in whom horror of the action itself absorbed
  every other feeling. Murder of this kind was new in England. Ready as the
  people ever were with sword or lance&mdash;incurably given as they were
  to fighting in the best ordered times&mdash;an Englishman was accustomed
  to face his enemy, man to man, in the open day; and the Italian crime (as
  it was called) of poisoning had not till recent years been heard of.<a
  name="NtA_300"></a><a href="#Nt_300"><sup>300</sup></a> Even revenge and
  passion recognised their own laws of honour and fair play; and the
  cowardly ferocity which would work its vengeance in the dark, and
  practise destruction by wholesale to implicate one hated person in the
  catastrophe, was a new feature of criminality. Occurring in a time so
  excited, when all minds were on the stretch, and imaginations were
  feverish with fancies, it appeared like a frightful portent, some prodigy
  of nature, or enormous new birth of wickedness, not to be received or
  passed by as a common incident, and not to be dealt with by the process
  of ordinary law. Parliament undertook the investigation, making it the
  occasion, when the evidence was completed, of a special statute, so
  remarkable that I quote it in its detail and wording. The English were a
  stern people&mdash;a people knowing little of compassion where no lawful
  ground existed for it; but they were possessed of an awful and solemn
  horror of evil things,&mdash;a feeling which, in proportion as it exists,
  inevitably and necessarily issues in tempers of iron. The stern man is
  ever the most tender when good remains amidst evil, and is still
  contending with it; but we purchase compassion for utter wickedness only
  by doubting in our hearts whether wickedness is more than misfortune.</p>

  <p>"The King's royal Majesty," says the 9th of the 22nd of Henry VIII.,
  "calling to his most blessed remembrance that the making of good and
  wholesome laws, and due execution of the same against the offenders
  thereof, is the only cause that good obedience and order hath been
  preserved in this realm; and his Highness having most tender zeal for the
  same, considering that man's life above all things is chiefly to be
  favoured, and voluntary murders most highly to be detested and abhorred;
  and specially all kinds of murders by poisoning, which in this realm
  hitherto, our Lord be thanked, hath been most rare and seldom committed
  or practised: and now, in the time of this present parliament, that is to
  say, on the eighteenth day of February, in <!-- Page 187 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span> the twenty-second
  year of his most victorious reign, one Richard Rouse, late of Rochester,
  in the county of Kent, cook, otherwise called Richard Cook, of his most
  wicked and damnable disposition, did cast a certain venom or poison into
  a vessel replenished with yeast or barm, standing in the kitchen of the
  reverend father in God, John Bishop of Rochester, at his place in Lambeth
  Marsh; with which yeast or barm, and other things convenient, porridge or
  gruel was forthwith made for his family there being; whereby not only the
  number of seventeen persons of his said family, which did eat of that
  porridge, were mortally infected or poisoned, and one of them, that is to
  say, Bennet Curwan, gentleman, is thereof deceased; but also certain poor
  people which resorted to the said bishop's place, and were there
  charitably fed with the remains of the said porridge and other victuals;
  were in like wise infected; and one poor woman of them, that is to say,
  Alice Tryppitt, widow, is also thereof now deceased: Our said sovereign
  lord the king, of his blessed disposition inwardly abhorring all such
  abominable offences, because that in manner no person can live in surety
  out of danger of death by that means, if practices thereof should not be
  eschewed, hath ordained and enacted by authority of this present
  parliament, that the said poisoning be adjudged and deemed as high
  treason; and that the said Richard, for the said murder and poisoning of
  the said two persons, shall stand and be attainted of high treason.</p>

  <p>"And because that detestable offence, now newly practised and
  committed, requireth condign punishment for the same, it is ordained and
  enacted by authority of this present parliament that the said Richard
  Rouse shall be therefore boiled to death, without having any advantage of
  his clergy; and that from henceforth every wilful murder of any person or
  persons hereafter to be committed or done by means or way of poisoning,
  shall be reputed, deemed, and judged in the law to be high treason; and
  that all and every person or persons which shall hereafter be indicted
  and condemned by order of the law of such treason, shall not be admitted
  to the benefit of his or their clergy, but shall be immediately after
  such attainder or condemnation, committed to execution of death by
  boiling for the same."</p>

  <p>The sentence was carried into effect<a name="NtA_301"></a><a
  href="#Nt_301"><sup>301</sup></a> in Smithfield, "on the tenebra
  Wednesday following, to the terrible example of all others." The
  spectacle of a living human being boiled to death, was really witnessed
  three hundred years ago by the London <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span> citizens, within
  the walls of that old cattle-market; an example terrible indeed, the
  significance of which is not easily to be exhausted. For the poisoners of
  the soul there was the stake,<a name="NtA_302"></a><a
  href="#Nt_302"><sup>302</sup></a> for the poisoners of the body, the
  boiling cauldron,&mdash;the two most fearful punishments for the most
  fearful of crimes. The stake at which the heretic suffered was an
  inherited institution descending through the usage of centuries; the
  poisoner's cauldron was the fresh expression of the judgment of the
  English nation on a novel enormity; and I have called attention to it
  because the temper which this act exhibits is the key to all which has
  seemed most dark and cruel in the rough years which followed; a temper
  which would keep no terms with evil, or with anything which, rightly or
  wrongly, was believed to be evil, but dreadfully and inexorably hurried
  out the penalties of it.</p>

  <p>Following the statute against poisoning, there stands "an act for the
  banishment out of the country of divers outlandish and vagabond people
  called Egyptians;"<a name="NtA_303"></a><a
  href="#Nt_303"><sup>303</sup></a> and attached to it another of analogous
  import, "for the repression of beggars and vagabonds," the number of
  whom, it was alleged, was increasing greatly throughout the country, and
  much crime and other inconveniences were said to have been occasioned by
  them. We may regard these two measures, if we please, as a result of the
  energetic and reforming spirit in the parliament, which was dragging into
  prominence all forms of existing disorders, and devising remedies for
  those disorders. But they indicate something more than this: they point
  to the growth of a disturbed and restless disposition, the interruption
  of industry, and other symptoms of approaching social confusion; and at
  the same time they show us the government conscious of the momentous
  nature of the struggle into which it was launched; and with timely energy
  bracing up the sinews of the nation for its approaching trial. The act
  against the gipsies especially, illustrates one of the most remarkable
  features of the times. The air was impregnated with superstition; in a
  half consciousness of the impending changes, all men were listening with
  wide ears to rumours and prophecies and fantastic fore-shadowings of the
  future; and fanaticism, half deceiving and half itself deceived, <!--
  Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>
  was grasping the lever of the popular excitement to work out its own
  ends.<a name="NtA_304"></a><a href="#Nt_304"><sup>304</sup></a> The power
  which had ruled the hearts of mankind for ten centuries was shaking
  suddenly to its foundation. The Infallible guidance of the Church was
  failing; its light gone out, or pronounced to be but a mere deceitful
  ignis fatuus; and men found themselves wandering in darkness, unknowing
  where to turn or what to think or believe. It was easy to clamour against
  the spiritual courts. From men smarting under the barefaced oppression of
  that iniquitous jurisdiction, the immediate outcry rose without ulterior
  thought; but unexpectedly the frail edifice of the church itself
  threatened under the attack to crumble into ruins; and many gentle hearts
  began to tremble and recoil when they saw what was likely to follow on
  their light beginnings. It was true that the measures as yet taken by the
  parliament and the crown professed to be directed, not to the overthrow
  of the church, but to the re-establishment of its strength. But the
  exulting triumph of the Protestants, the promotion of Latimer to a royal
  chaplaincy, the quarrel with the papacy, and a dim but sure perception of
  the direction in which the stream was flowing, foretold to earnest
  Catholics a widely different issue; and the simplest of them knew better
  than the court knew, that they were drifting from the sure moorings of
  the faith into the broad ocean of uncertainty. There seems, indeed, to be
  in religious men, whatever be their creed, and however limited their
  intellectual power, a prophetic faculty of insight into the true bearings
  of outward things,&mdash;an insight which puts to shame the sagacity of
  statesmen, and claims for the sons of God, and only for them, the wisdom
  even of the world. Those only read the world's future truly who have
  faith in principle, as opposed to faith in human dexterity; who feel that
  in human things there lies really and truly a spiritual nature, a
  spiritual connection, a spiritual tendency, which the wisdom of the
  serpent cannot alter, and scarcely can affect.</p>

  <p>Excitement, nevertheless, is no guarantee for the understanding; and
  these instincts, powerful as they are, may be found often in minds wild
  and chaotic, which, although they vaguely foresee the future, yet have no
  power of sound judgment, and know not what they foresee, or how wisely to
  estimate it. Their wisdom, if we may so use the word, combines crudely
  with <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>[pg
  190]</span> any form of superstition or fanaticism. Thus in England, at
  the time of which we are speaking, Catholics and Protestants had alike
  their horoscope of the impending changes, each nearer to the truth than
  the methodical calculations of the statesmen; yet their foresight did not
  affect their convictions, or alter the temper of their hearts. They
  foresaw the same catastrophe, yet their faith still coloured the
  character of it. To the one it was the advent of Antichrist, to the other
  the inauguration of the millennium. The truest hearted men on all sides
  were deserted by their understandings at the moment when their
  understandings were the most deeply needed: and they saw the realities
  which were round them transfigured into phantoms through the mists of
  their hopes and fears. The present was significant only as it seemed in
  labour with some gigantic issue, and the events of the outer world flew
  from lip to lip, taking as they passed every shape most wild and
  fantastical. Until "the king's matter" was decided, there was no
  censorship upon speech, and all tongues ran freely on the great subjects
  of the day. Every parish pulpit rang with the divorce, or with the perils
  of the Catholic faith; at every village ale-house, the talk was of St.
  Peter's keys, the sacrament, or of the pope's supremacy, or of the points
  in which a priest differed from a layman. Ostlers quarrelled over such
  questions as they groomed their masters' horses; old women mourned across
  the village shopboards of the evil days which were come or coming; while
  every kind of strangest superstition, fairy stories and witch stories,
  stories of saints and stories of devils, were woven in and out and to and
  fro, like quaint, bewildering arabesques, in the tissue of the general
  imagination.<a name="NtA_305"></a><a
  href="#Nt_305"><sup>305</sup></a></p>

  <p>These were the forces which were working on the surface of the English
  mind; while underneath, availing themselves skilfully of the excitement,
  the agents of the disaffected among the clergy, or the friars mendicant,
  who to a man were devoted to the pope and to Queen Catherine, passed up
  and down the country, denouncing the divorce, foretelling ruin, disaster,
  and the wrath of God; and mingling with their prophecies more than
  dubious language on the near destruction or deposition of a prince who
  was opposing God and Heaven. The soil was manured by treason, and the
  sowers made haste to use their opportunity. Thus especially was there
  danger in those wandering encampments of "outlandish people," whose
  habits rendered <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span> them the ready-made missionaries of
  sedition; whose swarthy features might hide a Spanish heart, and who in
  telling fortunes might readily dictate policy.<a name="NtA_306"></a><a
  href="#Nt_306"><sup>306</sup></a> Under the disguise of gipsies, the
  emissaries of the emperor or the pope might pass unsuspected from the
  Land's End to Berwick-upon-Tweed, penetrating the secrets of families,
  tying the links of the Catholic organisation: and in the later years of
  the struggle, as the intrigues became more determined and a closer
  connection was established between the Continental powers and the
  disaffected English, it became necessary to increase the penalty against
  these irregular wanderers from banishment to death. As yet, however, the
  milder punishment was held sufficient, and even this was imperfectly
  enforced.<a name="NtA_307"></a><a href="#Nt_307"><sup>307</sup></a> The
  tendencies to treason were still incipient&mdash;they were tendencies
  only, which had as yet shown themselves in no decisive acts; the future
  was uncertain, the action of the government doubtful. The aim was rather
  to calm down the excitement of the people, and to extinguish with as
  little violence as possible the means by which it was fed.</p>

  <p>Ominous symptoms of eccentric agitation, however, began to take shape
  in the confusion, A preacher, calling himself the favourite of the Virgin
  Mary, had started up at Edinburgh, professing miraculous powers of
  abstinence from food. This man was sent by James V. to Rome, where, after
  having been examined by Clement, and having sufficiently proved his
  mission, he was furnished with a priest's habit and a certificate under
  leaden seal.<a name="NtA_308"></a><a href="#Nt_308"><sup>308</sup></a>
  Thus equipped, he went a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and loaded himself with
  palm-leaves and with stones from the pillar at which Christ was scourged;
  and from thence making his way to England, he appeared at Paul's Cross an
  evident saint and apostle, cursing the king and his divorce, denouncing
  his apostacy, and threatening the anger of Heaven. He was arrested and
  thrown into prison, where he remained, as it was believed, fifty days
  without food, or fed in secret by the Virgin, At the close of the time
  the government thought it <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span> prudent to send him back to Scotland,
  without further punishment.<a name="NtA_309"></a><a
  href="#Nt_309"><sup>309</sup></a></p>

  <p>Another more famous prophetess was then in the zenith of her
  reputation&mdash;the celebrated Nun of Kent&mdash;whose cell at
  Canterbury, for some three years, was the Delphic shrine of the Catholic
  oracle, from which the orders of Heaven were communicated even to the
  pope himself. This singular woman seems for a time to have held in her
  hand the balance of the fortunes of England. By the papal party she was
  universally believed to be inspired. Wolsey believed it, Warham believed
  it, the bishops believed it, Queen Catherine believed it, Sir Thomas
  More's philosophy was no protection to him against the same delusion; and
  finally, she herself believed the world, when she found the world
  believed in her. Her story is a psychological curiosity; and, interwoven
  as it was with the underplots of the time, we cannot observe it too
  accurately.</p>

  <p>In the year 1525, there lived in the parish of Aldington, in Kent, a
  certain Thomas Cobb, bailiff or steward to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
  who possessed an estate there. Among the servants of this Thomas Cobb was
  a country girl called Elizabeth Barton&mdash;a decent person, so far as
  we can learn, but of mere ordinary character, and until that year having
  shown nothing unusual in her temperament. She was then attacked, however,
  by some internal disease; and after many months of suffering, she was
  reduced into that abnormal and singular condition, in which she exhibited
  the phenomena known to modern wonder-seekers as those of somnambulism or
  clairvoyance. The scientific value of such phenomena is still
  undetermined, but that they are not purely imaginary is generally agreed.
  In the histories of all countries and of all times, we are familiar with
  accounts of young women of bad health and irritable nerves, who have
  exhibited at recurring periods certain unusual powers; and these
  exhibitions have had especial attraction for superstitious persons,
  whether they have believed in God, or in the devil, or in neither. A
  further feature also uniform in such cases, has been that a small element
  of truth may furnish a substructure for a considerable edifice of
  falsehood; human credulity being always an insatiable faculty, and its
  powers being unlimited when once the path of ordinary experience has been
  transcended. We have seen in our own time to what excesses occurrences of
  this kind may tempt the belief, even when defended with the armour of
  science. In the sixteenth century, when demoniacal <!-- Page 193 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span> possession was the
  explanation usually received even of ordinary insanity, we can well
  believe that the temptation must have been great to recognise
  supernatural agency in a manifestation far more uncommon; and that the
  difficulty of retaining the judgment in a position of equipoise must have
  been very great not only to the spectators but still more to the subject
  of the phenomenon herself. To sustain ourselves continuously under the
  influence of reason, even when our faculties are preserved in their
  natural balance, is a task too hard for most of us. We cannot easily make
  too great allowance for the moral derangement likely to follow, when a
  weak girl suddenly found herself possessed of powers which she was unable
  to understand. Bearing this in mind, for it is only just that we should
  do so, we continue the story.</p>

  <p>This Elizabeth Barton, then, "in the trances, of which she had divers
  and many,<a name="NtA_310"></a><a href="#Nt_310"><sup>310</sup></a>
  consequent upon her illness, told wondrously things done and said in
  other places whereat she was neither herself present, nor yet had heard
  no report thereof." To simple-minded people who believed in Romanism and
  the legends of the saints, the natural explanation of such a marvel was,
  that she must be possessed either by the Holy Ghost or by the devil. The
  archbishop's bailiff, not feeling himself able to decide in a case of so
  much gravity, called in the advice of the parish priest, one Richard
  Masters; and together they observed carefully all that fell from her. The
  girl had been well disposed, as the priest probably knew. She had been
  brought up religiously; and her mind running upon what was most familiar
  to it, "she spake words of marvellous holyness in rebuke of sin and
  vice;"<a name="NtA_311"></a><a href="#Nt_311"><sup>311</sup></a> or, as
  another account says, "she spake very godly certain things concerning the
  seven deadly sins and the Ten Commandments."<a name="NtA_312"></a><a
  href="#Nt_312"><sup>312</sup></a> This seemed satisfactory as to the
  source of the inspiration. It was clearly not a devil that spoke words
  against sin, and therefore, as there was no other alternative, it was
  plain that God had visited her. Her powers were assuredly from heaven;
  and it was plain, also, by a natural sequence of reasoning, that she held
  some divine commission, of which her clairvoyance was the miracle in
  attestation.</p>

  <p>An occurrence of such moment was not to be kept concealed in the
  parish of Aldington. The priest mounted his horse, and <!-- Page 194
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span> rode to
  Lambeth with the news to the Archbishop of Canterbury; and the story
  having lost nothing of its marvel by the way,<a name="NtA_313"></a><a
  href="#Nt_313"><sup>313</sup></a> the archbishop, who was fast sinking
  into dotage, instead of ordering a careful inquiry, and appointing some
  competent person to conduct it, listened with greedy interest; he assured
  Father Richard that "the speeches which she had spoken came of God; and
  bidding him keep him diligent account of all her utterances, directed him
  to inform her in his name that she was not to refuse or hide the goodness
  and works of God." Cobb, the bailiff, being encouraged by such high
  authority, would not keep any longer in his kitchen a prophetess with the
  archbishop's imprimatur upon her; and as soon as the girl was
  sufficiently recovered from her illness to leave her bed, he caused her
  to sit at his own mess with his mistress and the parson.<a
  name="NtA_314"></a><a href="#Nt_314"><sup>314</sup></a> The story spread
  rapidly through the country; inquisitive foolish people came about her to
  try her skill with questions; and her illness, as she subsequently
  confessed, having then left her, and as only her reputation was
  remaining, she bethought herself whether it might not be possible to
  preserve it a little longer. "Perceiving herself to be much made of, to
  be magnified and much set by, by reason of trifling words spoken
  unadvisedly by idleness of her brain, she conceived in her mind that
  having so good success, and furthermore from so small an occasion and
  nothing to be esteemed, she might adventure further to enterprise and
  essay what she could do, being in good advisement and remembrance."<a
  name="NtA_315"></a><a href="#Nt_315"><sup>315</sup></a> Her fits no
  longer recurred naturally, but she was able to reproduce either the
  reality or the appearance of them; and she continued to improvise her
  oracles with such ability as she could command, and with tolerable
  success.</p>

  <p>In this undertaking she was speedily provided with an efficient
  coadjutor. The Catholic church had for some time been unproductive of
  miracles, and as heresy was raising its head and attracting converts, so
  opportune an occurrence was not to be allowed to sleep. The archbishop
  sent his comptroller to the Prior of Christ Church at Canterbury, with
  directions that two monks whom he especially named, Doctor Bocking, the
  cellarer, and Dan William Hadley, should go to Aldington to observe.<a
  name="NtA_316"></a><a href="#Nt_316"><sup>316</sup></a> At first, not
  knowing what was before them, both prior and monks were unwilling to
  meddle with the matter.<a name="NtA_317"></a><a
  href="#Nt_317"><sup>317</sup></a> They submitted, however, "from the
  obedience which they <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span> owed unto their lord;" and they had
  soon reason to approve the correctness of the archbishop's judgment.
  Bocking, selected no doubt from previous knowledge of his qualities, was
  a man devoted to his order, and not over-scrupulous as to the means by
  which he furthered the interests of it. With instinctive perception he
  discovered material in Elizabeth Barton too rich to be allowed to waste
  itself in a country village. Perhaps he partially himself believed in
  her, but he was more anxious to ensure the belief of others, and he
  therefore set himself to assist her inspiration towards more effective
  utterance. Conversing with her in her intervals of quiet, he discovered
  that she was wholly ignorant, and unprovided with any stock of mental or
  imaginative furniture; and that consequently her prophecies were without
  body, and too indefinite to be theologically available. This defect he
  remedied by instructing her in the Catholic legends, and by acquainting
  her with the revelations of St. Brigitt and St. Catherine of Sienna.<a
  name="NtA_318"></a><a href="#Nt_318"><sup>318</sup></a> In these women
  she found an enlarged reflection of herself; the details of their visions
  enriched her imagery; and being provided with these fair examples, she
  was able to shape herself into fuller resemblance with the traditionary
  model of the saints.</p>

  <p>As she became more proficient, Father Bocking extended his lessons to
  the Protestant controversy, initiating his pupil into the mysteries of
  justification, sacramental grace, and the power of the keys. The ready
  damsel redelivered his instructions to the world in her moments of
  possession; and the world discovered a fresh miracle in the inspired
  wisdom of the untaught peasant. Lists of these pregnant sayings were
  forwarded<a name="NtA_319"></a><a href="#Nt_319"><sup>319</sup></a>
  regularly to the archbishop, which still possibly lie mouldering in the
  Lambeth library, to be discovered by curious antiquaries. It is idle to
  inquire how far she was yet conscious of her falsehood. Conscious wilful
  deception lies far down the road in a course of this kind; and supported
  by the assurance of an archbishop, she was in all likelihood deep in
  lying before she actually knew it. Fanaticism and deceit are strangely
  near relations to each other, and the deceiver is often the person first
  deceived, and the last who is aware of the imposture.</p>

  <p>The instructions of the Father had made her acquainted with many
  stories of miraculous cures. The Catholic saints followed the type of the
  apostles, and to heal diseases by supernatural means was a more orthodox
  form of credential than <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span> clairvoyance or second sight. Being
  now cured of her real disorder, yet able to counterfeit the appearance of
  it, she could find no difficulty in arranging in her own case a miracle
  of the established kind, and so striking an incident would answer a
  further end. In the parish was a chapel of the Virgin, which was a place
  of pilgrimage; the pilgrims added something to the income of the priest;
  and if, by a fresh demonstration of the Virgin's presence at the favoured
  spot, the number of these pilgrims could be increased, they would add
  more. For both reasons, therefore, the miracle was desired; and the
  priest and the monk were agreed that any means were justifiable which
  would encourage the devotion of the people.<a name="NtA_320"></a><a
  href="#Nt_320"><sup>320</sup></a> Accordingly, the girl announced, in one
  of her trances, that "she would never take health of her body till such
  time as she had visited the image of our Lady" in that chapel. The Virgin
  had herself appeared to her, she said, and had fixed a day for her
  appearance there, and had promised that on her obedience she would
  present herself in person and take away her disorder.<a
  name="NtA_321"></a><a href="#Nt_321"><sup>321</sup></a> The day came; and
  as (under the circumstances) there was no danger of failure, the holy
  fathers had collected a vast concourse of people to witness the marvel.
  The girl was conducted to the chapel by a procession of more than two
  thousand persons, headed by the monk, the clergyman, and many other
  religious persons, the whole multitude "singing the Litany and saying
  divers psalms and orations by the way."</p>

  <p>"And when she was brought thither<a name="NtA_322"></a><a
  href="#Nt_322"><sup>322</sup></a> and laid before the image of our Lady,
  her face was wonderfully disfigured, her tongue hanging out, and her eyes
  being in a manner plucked out and laid upon her cheeks, and so greatly
  deformed. There was then heard a voice speaking within her belly, as it
  had been in a tonne, her lips not greatly moving: she all that while
  continuing by the space of three hours or more in a trance. The which
  voice, when it told of anything of the joys of heaven, spake so sweetly
  and so heavenly, that every man was ravished with the hearing thereof;
  and contrarywise, when it told anything of hell, it spake so horribly and
  terribly, that it put the hearers in a great fear. It spake also many
  things for the confirmation of pilgrimages and trentals, hearing of
  masses and confession, and many other such things. And after she had lyen
  there a long time, she came to herself again, and was perfectly whole. So
  this miracle was finished and solemnly <!-- Page 197 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> sung; and a book
  was written of all the whole story thereof, and put into print; which
  ever since that time was commonly sold, and went abroad among the
  people."</p>

  <p>The miracle successfully accomplished, the residence at Aldington was
  no longer adapted for an acknowledged and favoured saint. The Virgin
  informed her that she was to leave the bailiff and devote herself to her
  exclusive service. She was to be Sister Elizabeth, and her especial
  favourite; and Father Bocking was to be her spiritual father. The priory
  of St. Sepulchre's, Canterbury, was chosen for the place of her
  profession; and as soon as she was established in her cell, she became a
  recognised priestess or prophetess, alternately communicating
  revelations, or indulging the curiosity of foolish persons, and for both
  services consenting to be paid. The church had by this time spread her
  reputation through England. The book of her oracles, which extended soon
  to a considerable volume, was shown by Archbishop Warham to the king, who
  sent it to Sir Thomas More, desiring him to look at it. More's good sense
  had not yet forsaken him; he pronounced it "a right poor production, such
  as any simple woman might speak of her own wit;"<a name="NtA_323"></a><a
  href="#Nt_323"><sup>323</sup></a> and Henry himself "esteemed the matter
  as light as it afterwards proved lewd." But the world were less critical
  censors: the saintly halo was round her head, and her most trivial words
  caught the reflection of the glory, and seemed divine. "Divers and many,
  as well great men of the realm as mean men, and many learned men, but
  specially many religious men, had great confidence in her, and often
  resorted to her."<a name="NtA_324"></a><a
  href="#Nt_324"><sup>324</sup></a> They "consulted her much as to the will
  of God touching the heresies and schisms in the realm;" and when the
  dispute arose between the bishops and the House of Commons, they asked
  her what judgment there was in heaven "on the taking away the liberties
  of the church;" to which questions her answers, being dictated by her
  confessor, were all which the most eager churchman could desire. Her
  position becoming more and more determined, the eccentric periods of her
  earlier visions subsided into regularity. Once a fortnight she was taken
  up into heaven into the presence of God and the saints, with heavenly
  lights, heavenly voices, heavenly melodies and joys. The place of ascent
  was usually the priory chapel, to which it was essential, therefore, that
  she should have continual access: and she was allowed, in consequence, to
  pass <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>[pg
  198]</span> the dormitory door when she pleased&mdash;a privilege of
  which the Statute uncharitably hints that she availed herself for a less
  respectable purpose. But whatever was her secret conduct, her outward
  behaviour was in full keeping with her language and profession. She
  related many startling stories, not always of the most decent kind, of
  the attempts which the devil made to lead her astray. The devil and the
  angels were in fact alternate visitors to her cell, and the former, on
  one occasion, burnt a mark upon her hand, which she exhibited publicly,
  and to which the monks were in the habit of appealing, when there were
  any signs of scepticism in the visitors to the priory. On the occasion of
  these infernal visits, "great stinking smokes" were seen to issue from
  her chamber, "savouring grievously through all the dorture;" with which,
  however, it was suspected subsequently that a paper of brimstone and
  assaf&#339;tida, found among her property after her arrest, had been in
  some way connected. We smile at these stories, looking back at them with
  eyes enlightened by scientific scepticism; but they furnished matter for
  something else than smiles when the accounts of them could be exhibited
  by the clergy as a living proof of the credibility of the Aurea
  Legenda,&mdash;when the subject of them could be held up as a witness,
  accredited by miracles, to the truth of the old faith, a living evidence
  to shame the incredulity of the Protestant sectaries. She became a figure
  of great and singular significance; a "wise woman," to whom persons of
  the highest rank were not ashamed to have recourse to inquire of her the
  will of God, and to ask the benefit of her intercessory prayers, for
  which also they did not fail to pay at a rate commensurate with their
  credulity.<a name="NtA_325"></a><a href="#Nt_325"><sup>325</sup></a></p>

  <p>This position the Nun of Kent, as she was now called, had achieved for
  herself, when the divorce question was first agitated. The monks at the
  Canterbury priory, of course, eagerly espoused the side of the queen, and
  the Nun's services were at once in active requisition. Absurd as the
  stories of her revelations may seem to us, she had already given evidence
  that she was no vulgar impostor, and in the dangerous career on which she
  now entered, she conducted herself with the utmost skill and <!-- Page
  199 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span>
  audacity. Far from imitating the hesitation of the pope and the bishops,
  she issued boldly, "in the name and by the authority of God," a solemn
  prohibition against the king; threatening that, if he divorced his wife,
  he should not "reign a month, but should die a villain's death."<a
  name="NtA_326"></a><a href="#Nt_326"><sup>326</sup></a> Burdened with
  this message, she forced herself into the presence of Henry himself;<a
  name="NtA_327"></a><a href="#Nt_327"><sup>327</sup></a> and when she
  failed to produce an effect upon Henry's obdurate scepticism, she turned
  to the hesitating ecclesiastics, and roused their flagging spirits. The
  archbishop bent under her denunciations, and at her earnest request
  introduced her to Wolsey, then tottering on the edge of ruin.<a
  name="NtA_328"></a><a href="#Nt_328"><sup>328</sup></a> He, too, in his
  confusion and perplexity, was frightened, and doubted. She made herself
  known to the papal ambassadors, and through them she took upon herself to
  threaten Clement,<a name="NtA_329"></a><a
  href="#Nt_329"><sup>329</sup></a> assuming, in virtue of her <!-- Page
  200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> divine
  commission, an authority above all principalities and powers. If it were
  likely that she could have heard the story of the Maid of Orleans, it
  might be supposed that her imagination tempted her to play again a
  similar career on an English stage, and that she fancied herself the
  destined saviour of the Church of Christ, as the Maid had been the
  saviour of France.</p>

  <p>It would indeed be a libel on the fair fame of Joan of Arc, if she
  were to be compared to a confessed impostor; but Joan of Arc might have
  been the reality which the Nun attempted to counterfeit; and the history
  of the true heroine might have suggested easily to the imitator the
  outline of her part. A revolution had been effected in Europe by a
  somnambulist peasant girl; another peasant girl, a somnambulist also,
  might have seen in the achievement which had been already accomplished,
  an earnest of what might be done by herself. While we call the Nun, too,
  an impostor, we are bound to believe that she first imposed upon herself,
  and that her wildest adventures into falsehood were compatible with a
  belief that she was really and truly inspired. Nothing short of such a
  conviction would have enabled her to play a part among kings and queens,
  and so many of the ablest statesmen of that most able age. Nothing else
  could have tempted her, on the failure of her prophecies, into the
  desperate career of treason into which we are soon to see her
  launched.</p>

  <p>Her proceedings were known partially, but partially only, to the king;
  and the king seems to have been the only person whose understanding was
  proof against her influence. To him she appeared nothing worse than an
  excited fanatic, and he allowed her to go her own way, as the best
  escapement of a frenzy. Until parliament had declared it illegal to
  discuss the marriage question further, he interfered with no one, and
  therefore not with her. If her own word was to be taken, he even showed
  her much personal kindness, having offered to make her an abbess, which
  is difficult to believe, especially as she said that she had refused his
  offer. She stated also that at the time of Lord Wiltshire's mission to
  the emperor, the Countess of Wiltshire endeavoured to persuade her to
  accept a place at the court, as a companion to Anne; which again is
  unsupported by other evidence, and sounds improbable.<a
  name="NtA_330"></a><a href="#Nt_330"><sup>330</sup></a> But it is plain,
  that until she was found to be meditating treason, she experienced no
  treatment from the government of which she had cause to complain; and
  thus for the present we may leave <!-- Page 201 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span> her pursuing her
  machinations with the Canterbury friars, and return to the
  parliament.</p>

  <p>The second session had been longer than the first; it had commenced on
  the 16th of January, and continued for ten weeks. On the 30th of March,
  which was to be its last day, Sir Thomas More came down to the House of
  Commons, and there read aloud to the members the decision of the various
  universities on the papal power, and the judgment of European learning on
  the general question of the king's divorce. The country, he said, was
  much disturbed, and the king desired them each to report what they had
  heard in their several counties and towns, "in order that all men might
  perceive that he had not attempted this matter of his own will or
  pleasure, as some strangers reported, but only for the discharge of his
  conscience and surety of the succession of his realm."<a
  name="NtA_331"></a><a href="#Nt_331"><sup>331</sup></a> This appears to
  have been the first time that the subject was mentioned before
  parliament, and the occasion was reasonably and sensibly chosen. The
  clergy having possession of the pulpits, had used their opportunity to
  spread a false impression where the ignorance of the people would allow
  them to venture the experiment; the king having resolved to fall back
  upon the support of his subjects, naturally desired the assistance of the
  country gentlemen and the nobles to counteract the efforts of
  disaffection, and provided them with accurate information in the simplest
  manner which he could have chosen.</p>

  <p>But the desire expressed by Henry was no more than an unnecessary
  form, for as a body, the educated laity were as earnestly bent upon the
  divorce as the king himself could be, and might have been trusted to use
  all means by which to further it. The parliament was prorogued, but the
  Lords, shortly after the separation, united with such of the Commons as
  remained in London, to give a proof of their feeling by a voluntary
  address to the pope. The meaning of this movement was not to be mistaken.
  On one side, the Nun of Kent was threatening Clement, speaking, perhaps,
  the feelings of the clergy and of all the women in England; on the other
  side, the parliament thought well to threaten him, speaking for the great
  body of English <i>men</i>, for all persons of substance and property,
  who desired above all things peace and order and a secured
  succession.</p>

  <p>The language of this remarkable document<a name="NtA_332"></a><a
  href="#Nt_332"><sup>332</sup></a> was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span>

  <p>"To the Most Holy Lord our Lord and Father in Christ, Clement, by
  Divine Providence the seventh of that name, we desire perpetual happiness
  in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>"Most blessed Father, albeit the cause concerning the marriage of the
  most invincible prince, our sovereign lord, the King of England and of
  France, Defender of the Faith, and Lord of Ireland, does for sundry great
  and weighty reasons require and demand the aid of your Holiness, that it
  may be brought to that brief end and determination which we with so great
  and earnest desire have expected, and which we have been contented
  hitherto to expect, though so far vainly, at your Holiness's hands; we
  have been unable, nevertheless, to keep longer silence herein, seeing
  that this kingdom and the affairs of it are brought into so high peril
  through the unseasonable delay of sentence. His Majesty, who is our head,
  and by consequence the life of us all, and we through him as subject
  members by a just union annexed to the head, have with great earnestness
  entreated your Holiness for judgment; we have however entreated in vain:
  we are by the greatness of our grief therefore forced separately and
  distinctly by these our letters most humbly to demand a speedy
  determination. There ought, indeed, to have been no need of this request
  on our part. The justice of the cause itself, approved to be just by the
  sentence of so many learned men, by the suffrage of the most famous
  universities in England, France, and Italy, should have sufficed alone to
  have induced your Holiness to confirm the sentence given by others;
  especially when the interests of a king and kingdom are at stake, which
  in so many ways have deserved well of the apostolic see. This we say
  ought to have been motive sufficient with you, without need of petition
  on our part; and if we had added our entreaties, it should have been but
  as men yielding to a causeless anxiety, and wasting <!-- Page 203
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span> words for
  which there was no occasion. Since, however, neither the merit of the
  cause nor the recollection of the benefits which you have received, nor
  the assiduous and diligent supplications of our prince have availed
  anything with your Holiness; since we cannot obtain from you what it is
  your duty as a father to grant; the load of our grief, increased as it is
  beyond measure by the remembrance of the past miseries and calamities
  which have befallen this nation, makes vocal every member of our
  commonwealth, and compels us by word and letter to utter our
  complaints.</p>

  <p>"For what a misfortune is this,&mdash;that a sentence which our own
  two universities, which the University of Paris, and many other
  universities in France, which men of the highest learning and probity
  everywhere, at home and abroad, are ready to defend with word and pen,
  that such sentence, we say, cannot be obtained from the apostolic see by
  a prince to whom that see owes its present existence. Amidst the attacks
  of so many and so powerful enemies, the King of England ever has stood by
  that see with sword and pen, with voice and with authority. Yet he alone
  is to reap no benefit from his labours. He has saved the papacy from
  ruin, that others might enjoy the fruits of the life which he has
  preserved for it. We see not what answer can be made to this; and
  meanwhile we perceive a flood of miseries impending over the
  commonwealth, threatening to bring back upon us the ancient controversy
  on the succession, which had been extinguished only with so much blood
  and slaughter. We have now a king most eminent for his virtues, and
  reigning by unchallenged title, who will secure assured tranquillity to
  the realm if he leave a son born of his body to succeed him. The sole
  hope that such a son may be born to him lies in the being found for him
  some lawful marriage into which he may enter; and to such marriage the
  only obstacle lies with your Holiness. It cannot be until you shall
  confirm the sentence of so many learned men on the character of his
  former connection. This if you will not do, if you who ought to be our
  father have determined to leave us as orphans, and to treat us as
  castaways, we shall interpret such conduct to mean only that we are left
  to care for ourselves, and to seek our remedy elsewhere. We do not desire
  to be driven to this extremity, and therefore we beseech your Holiness
  without further delay to assist his Majesty's just and reasonable
  desires. We entreat you to confirm the judgment of these learned men; and
  for the sake of that love and fatherly affection which your office <!--
  Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>
  requires you to show towards us, not to close your bowels of compassion
  against us, your most dutiful, most loving, most obedient children. The
  cause of his Majesty is the cause of each of ourselves; the head cannot
  suffer, but the members must bear a part. We have all our common share in
  the pain and in the injury; and as the remedy is wholly in the power of
  your Holiness, so does the duty of your fatherly office require you to
  administer it. If, however, your Holiness will not do this, or if you
  choose longer to delay to do it, our condition hitherto will have been so
  much the more wretched, that we have so long laboured fruitlessly and in
  vain. But it will not be wholly irremediable; extreme remedies are ever
  harsh of application; but he that is sick will by any means be rid of his
  distemper; and there is hope in the exchange of miseries, when, if we
  cannot obtain what is good, we may obtain a lesser evil, and trust that
  time may enable us to endure it.</p>

  <p>"These things we beseech your Holiness, in the name of our Lord Jesus
  Christ, to consider with yourself. You profess that on earth you are His
  vicar. Endeavour, then, to show yourself so to be, by pronouncing your
  sentence to the glory and praise of God, and giving your sanction to that
  truth which has been examined, approved, and after much deliberation
  confirmed by the most learned men of all nations. We meanwhile will pray
  the all-good God, whom we know by most sure testimony to be truth itself,
  that He will deign so to inform and direct the counsels of your Holiness,
  that we obtaining by your authority what is holy, just, and true, may be
  spared from seeking it by other more painful methods."</p>

  <p>Thus was the great crisis steadily maturing itself, and the cause by
  this petition was made to rest upon its proper merits. The justification
  of the demand for the divorce was the danger of civil war; and into civil
  war the nation had no intention of permitting themselves to be drifted by
  papal imbecility. Whatever was the origin of Henry's resolution, it was
  acted out with calmness, and justified by sober reason; and backed by the
  good sense of his lay subjects, he proceeded bravely, in spite of
  excommunication, interdict, and the Nun of Kent, towards the object which
  his country's interests, as well as his own, required.</p>

  <p>It would have been well if his private behaviour as a man had been as
  unobjectionable as his conduct as a sovereign. Hitherto he had remained
  under the same roof with Queen Catherine, but with that indelicacy which
  was the singular blemish on his character, he had maintained her rival in
  the same household <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span> with the state of a princess,<a
  name="NtA_333"></a><a href="#Nt_333"><sup>333</sup></a> and needlessly
  wounded feelings which he was bound to have spared to the utmost which
  his duty permitted. The circumstances of the case, if they were known to
  us, though they could never excuse such a proceeding, might perhaps
  partially palliate it. Catherine was harsh and offensive, and it was by
  her own determination, and not by Henry's desire, that she was unprovided
  with an establishment elsewhere. There lay, moreover, as I have said,
  behind the scenes a whole drama of contention and bitterness, which now
  is happily concealed from us; but which being concealed, leaves us
  without the clue to these painful doings. Indelicate, however, the
  position given to Anne Boleyn could not but be; and, if it was indelicate
  in Henry to grant such a position, what shall we say of the lady who
  consented, in the presence of her sovereign and mistress, to wear such
  ignominious splendour?</p>

  <p>But in these most offensive relations there was henceforth to be a
  change. In June, 1531, two months after the prorogation of parliament, a
  deputation of the privy council went to the apartments of Catherine at
  Greenwich, and laying before her the papers which had been read by Sir
  Thomas More to the two Houses, demanded formally, whether, for the sake
  of the country, and for the quiet of the king's conscience, she would
  withdraw her appeal to Rome, and submit to an arbitration in the kingdom.
  It was, probably, but an official request, proposed without expectation
  that she would yield. After rejecting a similar entreaty from the pope
  himself, she was not likely, inflexible as she had ever been, to yield
  when the pope had admitted her appeal, and the emperor, victorious
  through Europe, had promised her support. She refused, of course, like
  herself, proudly, resolutely, gallantly, and not without the scorn which
  she was entitled to feel. The nation had no claims upon her, and "for the
  king's conscience," she answered, "I pray God send his Grace good quiet
  therein, and tell him I say I am his lawful wife, and to him lawfully
  married; and in that point I will abide till the court of Rome, which was
  privy to the beginning, <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span> hath made thereof a determination and
  a final ending."<a name="NtA_334"></a><a
  href="#Nt_334"><sup>334</sup></a> The learned councillors retired with
  their answer. A more passive resistance would have been more dignified;
  but Catherine was a queen, and a queen she chose to be; and in defence of
  her own high honour, and of her daughter's, by no act of hers would she
  abate one tittle of her dignity, or cease to assert her claim to it. Her
  reply, however, appears to have been anticipated, and the request was
  only preparatory to ulterior measures. For the sake of public decency,
  and certainly in no unkind spirit towards herself, a retirement from the
  court was now to be forced upon her. At Midsummer she accompanied the
  king to Windsor; in the middle of July he left her there, and never saw
  her again. She was removed to the More, a house in Hertfordshire, which
  had been originally built by George Neville, Archbishop of York, and had
  belonged to Wolsey, who had maintained it with his usual splendour.<a
  name="NtA_335"></a><a href="#Nt_335"><sup>335</sup></a> Once more an
  attempt was made to persuade her to submit; but with no better result,
  and a formal establishment was then provided for her at Ampthill, a large
  place belonging to Henry not far from Dunstable. There at least she was
  her own mistress, surrounded by her own friends, who were true to her as
  queen, and she attracted to her side from all parts of England those whom
  sympathy or policy attached to her cause. The court, though keeping a
  partial surveillance over her, did not dare to restrict her liberty; and
  as the measures against the church became more stringent, and a
  separation from the papacy more nearly imminent, she became the nucleus
  of a powerful political party. Her injuries had deprived the king and the
  nation of a right to complain of her conduct. She owed nothing to
  England. Her allegiance, politically, was to Spain; spiritually she was
  the subject of the pope; and this dubious position gave her an advantage
  which she was not slow to perceive. Rapidly every one rallied to her who
  adhered to the old faith, and to whom the measures of the government
  appeared a sacrilege. Through herself, or through her secretaries and
  confessors, a correspondence was conducted which brought the courts of
  the continent into connection with the various disaffected parties in
  England, with the Nun of Kent and her friars, with the Poles, the
  Nevilles, the Courtenays, and all the <!-- Page 207 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span> remaining faction
  of the White Rose. And so first the great party of sedition began to
  shape itself, which for sixty years, except in the shortlived interlude
  of its triumph under Catherine's daughter, held the nation on the edge of
  civil war. We shall see this faction slowly and steadily organising
  itself, starting from scattered and small beginnings, till at length it
  overspread all England and Ireland and Scotland, exploding from time to
  time in abortive insurrections, yet ever held in check by the tact and
  firmness of the government, and by the inherent loyalty of the English to
  the land of their birth. There was a proverb then current that "the
  treasons of England should never cease."<a name="NtA_336"></a><a
  href="#Nt_336"><sup>336</sup></a> It was perhaps fortunate that the papal
  cause was the cause of a foreign power, and could only be defended by a
  betrayal of the independence of the country. In Scotland and Ireland the
  insurrectionists were more successful, being supported in either instance
  by the national feeling. But the strength of Scotland had been broken at
  Flodden; and Ireland, though hating "the Saxons" with her whole heart,
  was far off and divided. The true danger was at home; and when the extent
  and nature of it is fairly known and weighed, we shall understand better
  what is called the "tyranny" of Henry VIII. and of Elizabeth; and rather
  admire the judgment than condemn the resolution which steered the country
  safe among those dangerous shoals. Elizabeth's position is more familiar
  to us, and is more reasonably appreciated because the danger was more
  palpable. Henry has been hardly judged because he trampled down the
  smouldering fire, and never allowed it to assume the form which would
  have justified him with the foolish and the unthinking. Once and once
  only the flame blazed out; but it was checked on the instant, and
  therefore it has been slighted and forgotten. But with despatches before
  his eyes, in which Charles V. was offering James of Scotland the hand of
  the Princess Mary, with the title for himself of Prince of England and
  Duke of York<a name="NtA_337"></a><a
  href="#Nt_337"><sup>337</sup></a>&mdash;with Ireland, as we shall
  speedily see it, in flame from end to end, and Dublin castle the one spot
  left <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>[pg
  208]</span> within the island on which the banner of St. George still
  floated&mdash;with a corps of friars in hair shirts and chains, who are
  also soon to be introduced to us, and an inspired prophetess at their
  head preaching rebellion in the name of God&mdash;with his daughter, and
  his daughter's mother in league against him, some forty thousand clergy
  to be coerced into honest dealing, and the succession to the crown
  floating in uncertainty&mdash;finally, with excommunication hanging over
  himself, and at length falling, and his deposition pronounced, Henry, we
  may be sure, had no easy time of it, and no common work to accomplish;
  and all these things ought to be present before our minds, as they were
  present before his mind, if we would see him as he was, and judge him as
  we would be judged ourselves.</p>

  <p>Leaving disaffection to mature itself, we return to the struggle
  between the House of Commons and the bishops, which recommenced in the
  following winter; first pausing to notice a clerical interlude of some
  illustrative importance which took place in the close of the summer. The
  clergy, as we saw, were relieved of their premunire on engaging to pay
  118,000 pounds within five years. They were punished for their general
  offences; the formal offence for which they were condemned being one
  which could not fairly be considered an offence at all. When they came to
  discuss therefore the manner in which the money was to be levied, they
  naturally quarrelled among themselves as to where the burden of the fine
  should fairly rest, and a little scene has been preserved to us by Hall,
  through which, with momentary distinctness, we can look in upon those
  poor men in their perplexity. The bishops had settled among themselves
  that each diocese should make its own arrangements; and some of these
  great persons intended to spare their own shoulders to the utmost decent
  extremity. With this object, Stokesley, Bishop of London, who was just
  then very busy burning heretics, and therefore in bad odour with the
  people, resolved to call a meeting of five or six of his clergy, on whom
  he could depend; and passing quietly with their assistance such
  resolutions as seemed convenient, to avoid in this way the more doubtful
  expedient of a large assembly.</p>

  <p>The necessary intimations were given, and the meeting was to be held
  on the 1st of September, in the Chapter-house of St. Paul's. The bishop
  arrived at the time appointed, but unhappily <!-- Page 209 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span> for his hopes, not
  only the chosen six, but with them six hundred of the clergy of
  Middlesex, accompanied by a mob of the London citizens, all gathered in a
  crowd at the Chapter-house door, and clamouring to be admitted.</p>

  <p>The bishop, trusting in the strength of the chains and bolts, and
  still hoping to manage the affair officially, sent out a list of persons
  who might be allowed to take part in the proceedings, and these with
  difficulty made their way to the entrance. A rush was made by the others
  as they were going in, and there was a scuffle, which ended for the
  moment in the victory of the officials: but the triumph was of brief
  duration; the excluded clergy were now encouraged by the people; they
  returned vigorously to the attack, broke down the doors, "struck the
  bishop's officers over the face," and the whole crowd, priests and laity,
  rushed together, storming and shouting, into the Chapter-house. The scene
  may be easily imagined; dust flying, gowns torn, heads broken, well-fed
  faces in the hot September weather steaming with anger and exertion, and
  every voice in loudest outcry. At length the clamour was partially
  subdued, and the bishop, beautifully equal to the emergency, arose bland
  and persuasive.</p>

  <p>"My brethren," he said, "I marvel not a little why ye be so heady. Ye
  know not what shall be said to you, therefore I pray you keep silence,
  and hear me patiently. My friends, ye all know that we be men, frail of
  condition and no angels; and by frailty and lack of wisdom we have
  misdemeaned ourselves towards the king our sovereign lord and his laws;
  so that all we of the clergy were in premunire, by reason whereof all our
  promotions, lands, goods, and chattels were to him forfeit, and our
  bodies ready to be imprisoned. Yet his Grace, moved with pity and
  compassion, demanded of us what we could say why he should not extend his
  laws upon us.</p>

  <p>"Then the fathers of the clergy humbly besought his Grace for mercy,
  to whom he answered he was ever inclined to mercy. Then for all our great
  offences we had but little penance; for when he might, by the rigour of
  his laws, have taken all our livelihoods, he was contented with one
  hundred thousand pounds, to be paid in five years. And though this sum
  may be more than we may easily bear, yet, by the rigour of his law, we
  should have borne the whole burden; whereupon, my brethren, I charitably
  exhort you to bear your parts of your livelihood and salary towards
  payment of this sum granted."<a name="NtA_338"></a><a
  href="#Nt_338"><sup>338</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span>

  <p>The ingenuity of this address deserved all praise; but the beauty of
  the form was insufficient to disguise the inconclusiveness of the
  reasoning. It confessed an offence which the hearers knew to be none; the
  true provocation which had led to the penalty&mdash;the unjust extortion
  of the high church officials&mdash;was ignored. The crowd laughed and
  hooted. The clergy fiercely tightened their purse-strings, and the bishop
  was heard out with hardly restrained indignation. "My lord," it was
  shortly answered by one of them, "twenty nobles a year is but a bare
  living for a priest. Victual and all else is now so dear that poverty
  enforceth us to say nay. Besides that, my lord, we never meddled with the
  cardinal's faculties. Let the bishops and abbots which have offended
  pay." Loud clamour followed and shouts of applause. The bishop's officers
  gave the priests high words. The priests threw back the taunts as they
  came; and the London citizens, delighting in the scandalous quarrel,
  hounded on the opposition. From words they passed to blows; the bedell
  and vergers tried to keep order, but "were buffeted and stricken,"<a
  name="NtA_339"></a><a href="#Nt_339"><sup>339</sup></a> and the meeting
  broke up in wild uproar and confusion. For this matter five of the lay
  crowd and fifteen London curates were sent to the Tower by Sir Thomas
  More; but the undignified man&#339;uvre had failed, and the fruit of it
  was but fresh disgrace. United, the clergy might have defied the king and
  the parliament; but in the race of selfishness the bishops and high
  dignitaries had cared only for their own advantage. They had left the
  poorer members of their order with no interest in common with that of
  their superiors, beyond the shield which the courts consented to extend
  over moral delinquency; and in the hour of danger they found themselves
  left naked and alone to bear the storm as they were able.</p>

  <p>This incident, and it was perhaps but one of many, is not likely to
  have softened the disposition of the Commons, or induced them to
  entertain more respectfully the bishops' own estimate of their
  privileges. The convocation and the parliament met simultaneously, on the
  15th of January, and the conflict, which had been for two years in
  abeyance, recommenced. The initial measure was taken by convocation, and
  this body showed a spirit still unsubdued, and a resolution to fight in
  their own feebly tyrannical manner to the last. A gentleman in
  Gloucestershire had lately died, by name Tracy. In his last testament he
  had bequeathed his soul to God through the <!-- Page 211 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span> mercies of Christ,
  declining the mediatorial offices of the saints; and leaving no money to
  be expended in masses.<a name="NtA_340"></a><a
  href="#Nt_340"><sup>340</sup></a> Such notorious heresy could not be
  passed over with impunity, and the first step of the assembled clergy<a
  name="NtA_341"></a><a href="#Nt_341"><sup>341</sup></a> was to issue a
  commission to raise the body and burn it. Their audacity displayed at
  once the power which they possessed, and the temper in which they were
  disposed to use it. The Archbishop of Canterbury seems to have been
  responsible for this monstrous order, which unfortunately was carried
  into execution before Henry had time to interfere.<a
  name="NtA_342"></a><a href="#Nt_342"><sup>342</sup></a> It was the last
  act of the kind, however, in which he was permitted to indulge, and the
  legislature made haste to take away such authority from hands so
  incompetent to use it. From their debates upon burning the dead Tracy,
  convocation were proceeding to discuss the possibility of burning the
  living Latimer,<a name="NtA_343"></a><a href="#Nt_343"><sup>343</sup></a>
  when they were recalled to their senses by a summons to prepare some more
  reasonable answer than that which the bishops had made for them on their
  privilege of making laws. Twenty more years of work were to be lived by
  Latimer before they were to burn him, and their own delinquencies were
  for the present of a more pressing nature. The House of Commons at the
  same time proceeded to frame necessary bills on the other points of their
  complaint.</p>

  <p>The first act upon the roll recalls the Constitutions of Clarendon and
  the famous quarrel between Becket and the Crown. When Catholicism was a
  living belief, when ordained priests were held really and truly to
  possess those awful powers which the mystery of transubstantiation
  assigns to them, they were acknowledged by common consent to be an order
  apart from the rest of mankind, and being spiritual men, to be amenable
  only to spiritual jurisdiction. It was not intended that, if they
  committed crimes, they should escape the retributive consequences of
  those crimes: offenders against the law might (originally at least) be
  degraded, if the bishops thought good, and stripped of their commission
  be delivered thus to the secular arm. But the more appropriate punishment
  for such persons was of a more awful kind, proportioned to the magnitude
  of the fault; and was conveyed or held to be conveyed in the infliction
  of the spiritual death of excommunication. Excommunication <!-- Page 212
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>[pg 212]</span> was, in
  real earnest, the death of the soul, at a time when communion with the
  church was the only means by which the soul could be made partaker of the
  divine life; and it was a noble thing to believe that there was something
  worse for a man than legal penalties on his person or on his mortal body;
  it was beautiful to recognise in an active living form, that the heaviest
  ill which could befall a man was to be cut off from God. But it is only
  for periods that humanity can endure the atmosphere of these high
  altitudes of morality. The early Christians attempted a community of
  goods, but they were unequal to it for more than a generation. The
  discipline of Catholicism was assisted by superstition,&mdash;it remained
  vigorous for many hundreds of years, but it languished at last; and
  although there was so great virtue in a living idea, that its forms
  preserved the reverence of mankind unabated, even when in their effect
  and working they had become as evil as they once were noble; yet
  reverence and endurance were at length exhausted, and these forms were to
  submit to alteration in conformity with the altered nature of the persons
  whom they affected.</p>

  <p>I have already alluded to the abuse of "benefit of clergy;"<a
  name="NtA_344"></a><a href="#Nt_344"><sup>344</sup></a> we have arrived
  at the first of those many steps by which at length it was finally put
  away,&mdash;a step which did not, however, as yet approach the heart of
  the evil, but touched only its extreme outworks. The clergy had
  monopolised the learning of the middle ages, and few persons external to
  their body being able to read or write, their privileges became
  co-extensive, as I above stated, with these acquirements. The exemption
  from secular jurisdiction, which they obtained in virtue of their sacred
  character, had been used as a protection in villainy for every scoundrel
  who could write his name. Under this plea, felons of the worst kind might
  claim, till this time, to be taken out of the hands of the law judges,
  and to be tried at the bishops' tribunals; and at these tribunals, such a
  monstrous solecism had Catholicism become, the payment of money was ever
  welcomed as the ready expiation of crime. To prevent the escape of the
  Bishop of Rochester's cook, who was a "clerk," parliament had specially
  interfered, and sentenced him without trial, by attainder. They now
  passed a general act, remarkable alike in what it provided as in what,
  for the present, it omitted to provide.<a name="NtA_345"></a><a
  href="#Nt_345"><sup>345</sup></a> The preamble related the nature of the
  evil which was to be remedied, and the historical position of it. It
  dwelt <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>[pg
  213]</span> upon the assurances which had been given again and again by
  the ordinaries that their privileges should not be abused; but these
  promises had been broken as often as they had been made; so that
  "continually manifest thieves and murderers, indicted and found guilty of
  their misdeeds by good and substantial inquests, and afterwards, by the
  usages of the common lawes of the land, delivered to the ordinaries as
  clerks convict, were speedily and hastily delivered and set at large by
  the ministers of the said ordinaries for corruption and lucre; or else
  because the ordinaries enclaiming such offenders by the liberties of the
  church would in no wise take the charges in safe keeping of them, but did
  suffer them to make their purgation by such as nothing knew of their
  misdeeds, and by such fraud did annull and make void the good and
  provable trial which was used against such offenders by the king's law;
  to the pernicious example, increase, and courage of such offenders, if
  the King's Highness by his authority royal put not speedy remedy
  thereto."</p>

  <p>To provide such necessary remedy, it was enacted that thenceforward no
  person under the degree of subdeacon, if guilty of felony, should be
  allowed to plead "his clergy" any more, but should be proceeded against
  by the ordinary law. So far it was possible to go&mdash;an enormous step
  if we think of what the evil had been; and in such matters to make a
  beginning was the true difficulty&mdash;it was the logical premise from
  which the conclusion could not choose but follow. Yet such was the
  mystical sacredness which clung about the ordained clergy, that their
  patent profligacy had not yet destroyed it&mdash;a priest might still
  commit a murder, and the profane hand of the law might not reach to
  him.</p>

  <p>The measure, however, if imperfect, was excellent in its degree; and
  when this had been accomplished, the House proceeded next to deal with
  the Arches Court&mdash;the one enormous grievance of the time. The
  petition of the Commons has already exhibited the condition of this
  institution; but the act by which the power of it was limited added more
  than one particular to what had been previously stated, and the first
  twenty lines of the statute which was now passed<a name="NtA_346"></a><a
  href="#Nt_346"><sup>346</sup></a> may be recommended to the consideration
  of the modern censors of the Reformation. The framer of the resolution
  was no bad friend to the bishops, if they had possessed the faculty of
  knowing who their true friends were, for the statement of complaint was
  limited, mild, and moderate. Again, as with the "benefit of <!-- Page 214
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span> clergy,"
  the real ground for surprise is that any fraction of a system so
  indefensible should have been permitted to continue. The courts were
  nothing else but the vicious sources of unjust revenue; and with the
  opportunity so fairly offered, it is strange indeed that they were not
  swept utterly away. But sweeping measures have never found favour in
  England. There has ever been in English legislation, even when most
  reforming, that temperate spirit of equity which has refused to visit the
  sins of centuries upon a single generation. The statute limited its
  accusations to the points which it was designed to correct, and touched
  these with a hand firmly gentle.</p>

  <p>"Whereas great numbers of the king's subjects," says the preamble, "as
  well men, wives, servants, or others dwelling in divers dioceses of the
  realm of England and Wales, heretofore have been at many times called by
  citations and other processes compulsory to appear in the Arches,
  Audience, and other high Courts of the archbishops of this realm, far
  from and out of the dioceses where such persons are inhabitant and
  dwelling; and many times to answer to surmised and feigned causes and
  matters, which have been sued more for vexation and malice than from any
  just cause of suit; and when certificate hath been made by the sumners,
  apparitors, or any such light litterate persons, that the party against
  whom such citations have been awarded hath been cited or summoned; and
  thereupon the same party so certified to be cited or summoned hath not
  appeared according to the certificate, the same party therefore hath been
  excommunicated, or, at the least, suspended from all divine service; and
  thereupon, before that he or she could be absolved, hath been compelled,
  not only to pay the fees of the court whereunto he or she was so called,
  amounting to the sum of two shillings, or twenty pence at the least; but
  also to pay to the sumner, for every mile distant from the place where he
  or she then dwelled unto the same court whereunto he or she was summoned
  to appear, twopence; to the great charge and impoverishment of the king's
  subjects, and to the great occasion of misbehaviour of wives, women, and
  servants, and to the great impairment and diminution of their good names
  and honesties&mdash;be it enacted&mdash;&mdash;" We ask
  what?&mdash;looking with impatience for some large measure to follow
  these solemn accusations; and we find parliament contenting itself with
  forbidding the bishops, under heavy penalties, to cite any man out of his
  own diocese, except for specified causes (heresy being one of them), and
  with limiting the fees which were to be taken by <!-- Page 215 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span> the officers of the
  courts.<a name="NtA_347"></a><a href="#Nt_347"><sup>347</sup></a> It
  could hardly be said that in this parliament there was any bitter spirit
  against the church. This act showed only mild forbearance and complacent
  endurance of all tolerable evil.</p>

  <p>Another serious matter was dealt with in the same moderate temper. The
  Mortmain Act had prohibited the church corporations from further
  absorbing the lands; but the Mortmain Act was evaded in detail, the
  clergy using their influence to induce persons on their deathbeds to
  leave estates to provide a priest for ever "to sing for their souls." The
  arrangement was convenient possibly for both parties, or if not for both,
  certainly for one; but to tie up lands for ever for a special service was
  not to the advantage of the country; and it was held unjust to allow a
  man a perpetual power over the disposition of property to atone for the
  iniquities of his life. But the privilege was not abolished altogether;
  it was submitted only to reasonable limitation. Men might still burden
  their lands to find a priest for twenty years. After twenty years the
  lands were to relapse for the service of the living, and sinners were
  expected in equity to bear the consequence in their own persons of such
  offences as remained after that time unexpiated.<a name="NtA_348"></a><a
  href="#Nt_348"><sup>348</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus, in two sessions, the most flagrant of the abuses first
  complained of were in a fair way of being remedied. The exorbitant
  charges for mortuaries, probate duties, legacy duties, the illegal
  exactions for the sacraments, the worst injustices of the ecclesiastical
  courts, the non-residence, pluralities, neglect of cures, the secular
  occupations and extravagant privileges of the clergy, were either
  terminated or brought within bounds. There remained yet to be disposed of
  the legislative power of the convocation and the tyrannical prosecutions
  for heresy. The last of these was not yet ripe for settlement; the former
  was under reconsideration by the convocation itself, which at length was
  arriving at a truer conception of its position; and this question was not
  therefore to be dealt with by the legislature.</p>

  <p>One more important measure, however, was passed by parliament <!--
  Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span>
  before it separated, and it is noticeable as the first step which was
  taken in the momentous direction of a breach with the See of Rome. A
  practice had existed for some hundreds of years in all the churches of
  Europe, that bishops and archbishops, on presentation to their sees,
  should transmit to the pope, on receiving their bulls of investment, one
  year's income from their new preferments. It was called the payment of
  annates, or firstfruits, and had originated in the time of the crusades,
  as a means of providing a fund for the holy wars. Once established, it
  had settled into custom,<a name="NtA_349"></a><a
  href="#Nt_349"><sup>349</sup></a> and was one of the chief resources of
  the papal revenue. From England alone, as much as 160,000 pounds had been
  paid out of the country in fifty years;<a name="NtA_350"></a><a
  href="#Nt_350"><sup>350</sup></a> and the impost was alike oppressive to
  individuals and injurious to the state. Men were appointed to bishopricks
  frequently at an advanced age, and dying, as they often did, within two
  or three years of their nomination, their elevation had sometimes
  involved their families and friends in debt and embarrassment;<a
  name="NtA_351"></a><a href="#Nt_351"><sup>351</sup></a> while the annual
  export of so much bullion was a serious evil at a time when the precious
  metals formed the only currency, and were so difficult to obtain. Before
  a quarrel with the court of Rome had been thought of as a possible
  contingency, the king had laboured with the pope to terminate the system
  by some equitable composition; and subsequently cessation of payment had
  been mentioned more than once in connection with the threats of a
  separation. The pope had made light of these threats, believing them to
  be no more than words; there was an opportunity, therefore, of proving
  that the English government was really in earnest, in a manner which
  would touch him in a point where he was naturally sensitive, and would
  show him at the same time that he could not wholly count on the
  attachment even of the clergy themselves. For, in fact, the church itself
  was fast disintegrating, and the allegiance even of the bishops and the
  secular clergy to Rome had begun to waver: they had a stronger faith in
  their own privileges than in the union of Christendom; and if they could
  purchase the continuance of the former at the price of a quarrel with the
  <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>[pg
  217]</span> pope, some among them were not disinclined to venture the
  alternative. The Bishop of Rochester held aloof from such tendencies, and
  Warham, though he signed the address of the House of Lords to the pope,
  regretted the weakness to which he had yielded: but in the other prelates
  there was little seriousness of conviction; and the constitution of the
  bench had been affected also by the preferment of Gardiner and Edward Lee
  to two of the sees made vacant by the death of Wolsey. Both these men had
  been active agents in the prosecution of the divorce; and Gardiner,
  followed at a distance by the other, had shaped out, as the pope grew
  more intractable, the famous notion that the English church could and
  should subsist as a separate communion, independent of foreign control,
  self governed, self organised, and at the same time adhering without
  variation to Catholic doctrine. This principle (if we may so abuse the
  word) shot rapidly into popularity: a party formed about it strong in
  parliament, strong in convocation, strong out of doors among the country
  gentlemen and the higher clergy&mdash;a respectable, wealthy, powerful
  body, trading upon a solecism, but not the less, therefore, devoted to
  its maintenance, and in their artificial horror of being identified with
  heresy, the most relentless persecutors of the Protestants. This party,
  unreal as they were, and influential perhaps in virtue of their
  unreality, became for the moment the arbiters of the Church of England;
  and the bishops belonging to it, and each rising ecclesiastic who hoped
  to be a bishop, welcomed the resistance of the annates as an opportunity
  for a demonstration of their strength. On this question, with a fair show
  of justice, they could at once relieve themselves of a burden which
  pressed upon their purses, and as they supposed, gratify the king. The
  conservatives were still numerically the strongest, and for a time
  remained in their allegiance to the Papacy,<a name="NtA_352"></a><a
  href="#Nt_352"><sup>352</sup></a> but their convictions were too feeble
  <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[pg
  218]</span> to resist the influence brought to bear upon them, and when
  Parliament re-assembled after the Easter recess, the two Houses of
  Convocation presented an address to the crown for the abolition of the
  impost, and with it of all other exactions, direct and
  indirect,&mdash;the indulgences, dispensations, delegacies, and the
  thousand similar forms and processes by which the privileges of the
  Church of England were abridged for the benefit of the Church of Rome,
  and weighty injury of purse inflicted both on the clergy and the laity.<a
  name="NtA_353"></a><a href="#Nt_353"><sup>353</sup></a></p>

  <p>That they contemplated a conclusive revolt from Rome as a consequence
  of the refusal to pay annates, appears positively in the close of their
  address: "May it please your Grace," they concluded, after detailing
  their occasions for complaint,&mdash;"may it please your Grace to cause
  the said unjust exactions to cease, and to be foredone for ever by act of
  your high Court of Parliament; and in case the pope will make process
  against this realm for the attaining those annates, or else will retain
  bishops' bulls till the annates be paid; forasmuch as the exaction of the
  said annates is against the law of God and the pope's own laws,
  forbidding the buying or selling of spiritual gifts or promotions; and
  forasmuch as all good Christian men be more bound to obey God than any
  man; and forasmuch as St. Paul willeth us to withdraw from all such as
  walk inordinately; may it please your Highness to ordain in this present
  parliament that the obedience of your Highness and of the people be
  withdrawn from the See of Rome."<a name="NtA_354"></a><a
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>354</sup></a></p>

  <p>It was perhaps cruel to compel the clergy to be the first to mention
  separation&mdash;or the language may have been furnished by the Erastian
  party in the Church, who hoped to gratify the King by it, and save the
  annates for themselves; but there was no intention, if the battle was
  really to be fought, of decorating the clergy with the spoils. The bill
  was passed, but passed conditionally, leaving power to the Crown if the
  pope would consent to a compromise of settling the question by a
  composition. There was a Papal party in the House of Commons whose
  opposition had perhaps to be considered,<a name="NtA_355"></a><a
  href="#Nt_355"><sup>355</sup></a> and the annates were left suspended
  before Clement at once as a menace and a bribe.</p>

<!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span>

  <p>"Forasmuch," concluded the statute, "as the King's Highness and this
  his high Court of Parliament neither have nor do intend in this or any
  other like cause any manner of extremity or violence, before gentle
  courtesy and friendly ways and means be first approved and attempted, and
  without a very great urgent cause and occasion given to the contrary; but
  principally coveting to disburden this Realm of the said great exactions
  and intolerable charges of annates and firstfruits: [the said Court of
  Parliament] have therefore thought convenient to commit the final order
  and determination of the premises unto the King's Highness, so that if it
  may seem to his high wisdom and most prudent discretion meet to move the
  Pope's Holiness and the Court of Rome, amicably, charitably, and
  reasonably, to compound either to extinct the said annates, or by some
  friendly, loving, and tolerable composition to moderate the same in such
  way as may be by this his Realm easily borne and sustained, then those
  ways of composition once taken shall stand in the strength, force, and
  effect of a law."<a name="NtA_356"></a><a
  href="#Nt_356"><sup>356</sup></a></p>

  <p>The business of the session was closing. It remained to receive the
  reply of convocation on the limitation of its powers. The convocation,
  presuming, perhaps, upon its concessions on the annates question, and
  untamed by the premunire, had framed their answer in the same spirit
  which had been previously exhibited by the bishops. They had re-asserted
  their claims as resting on divine authority, and had declined to
  acknowledge the right of any secular power to restrain or meddle with
  them.<a name="NtA_357"></a><a href="#Nt_357"><sup>357</sup></a> The
  second answer, as may be supposed, fared no better than the first. It was
  returned with a peremptory demand for submission; and taught by
  experience the uselessness of further opposition, the clergy with a bad
  grace complied. The form was again drawn by the bishops, and it is
  amusing to trace the workings of their humbled spirit in their reluctant
  descent from their high estate. They still laboured to protect their
  dignity in the terms of their concession:&mdash;</p>

<!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>

  <p>"As concerning such constitutions and ordinances provincial," they
  wrote, "as shall be made hereafter by your most humble subjects, we
  having our special trust and confidence in your most excellent wisdom,
  your princely goodness, and fervent zeal for the promotion of God's
  honour and Christian religion, and specially in your incomparable
  learning far exceeding in our judgment the learning of all other kings
  and princes that we have read of; and not doubting but that the same
  should still continue and daily increase in your Majesty; do offer and
  promise here unto the same, that from henceforth we shall forbear to
  enact, promulge, or put in execution any such constitutions and
  ordinances so by us to be made in time coming, unless your Highness by
  your Royal assent shall license us to make, promulge, and execute such
  constitutions, and the same so made be approved by your Highness's
  authority.</p>

  <p>"And whereas your Highness's most honourable Commons do pretend that
  divers of the constitutions provincial, which have been heretofore
  enacted, be not only much prejudicial to your Highness's prerogative
  royal, but be also overmuch onerous to your said Commons, we, your most
  humble servants for the consideration before said, be contented to refer
  all the said constitutions to the judgment of your Grace only. And
  whatsoever of the same shall finally be found prejudicial and overmuch
  onerous as is pretended, we offer and promise your Highness to moderate
  or utterly to abrogate and annul the same, according to the judgment of
  your Grace. Saving to us always such liberties and immunities of this
  Church of England as hath been granted unto the same by the goodness and
  benignity of your Highness and of others your most noble progenitors;
  with such constitutions provincial as do stand with the laws of Almighty
  God and of your Realm heretofore made, which we most humbly beseech your
  Grace to ratify and approve by your most Royal assent for the better
  execution of the same in times to come."<a name="NtA_358"></a><a
  href="#Nt_358"><sup>358</sup></a></p>

  <p>The acknowledgment appeared to be complete, and might perhaps have
  been accepted without minute examination, except for the imprudent
  acuteness of the Lower House of Convocation. As it passed through their
  hands, they discovered&mdash;what had no doubt been intended as a
  loophole for future evasion&mdash;that the grounds which were alleged to
  excuse the submission were the virtues of the reigning king: and
  therefore, as they sagaciously argued, the submission must only remain in
  force for his life. They introduced a limitation to that effect. Some
  further <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>[pg
  221]</span> paltry dabbling was also attempted with the phraseology: and
  at length, impatient with such dishonest trifling, and weary of a
  discussion in which they had resolved to allow but one conclusion, the
  king and the legislature thought it well to interfere with a high hand,
  and cut short such unprofitable folly. The language of the bishops was
  converted into an act of parliament; a mixed commission was appointed to
  revise the canon law, and the clergy with a few brief strokes were
  reduced for ever into their fit position of subjects.<a
  name="NtA_359"></a><a href="#Nt_359"><sup>359</sup></a> Thus with a
  moderate hand this great revolution was effected, and, to outward
  appearance, with offence to none except the sufferers, whose misuse of
  power when they possessed it deprived them of all sympathy in their
  fall.</p>

  <p>But no change of so vast a kind can be other than a stone of stumbling
  to those many persons for whom the beaten ways of life alone are
  tolerable, and who, when these ways are broken, are bewildered and lost.
  Religion, when men are under its influence at all, so absorbs their
  senses, and so pervades all their associations, that no faults in the
  ministers of it can divest their persons of reverence; and just and
  necessary as all these alterations were, many a pious and noble heart was
  wounded, many a man was asking himself in his perplexity where things
  would end, and still more sadly, where, if these quarrels deepened, would
  lie his own duty. Now the Nun of Kent grew louder in her Cassandra
  wailings. Now the mendicant friars mounted the pulpits exclaiming
  sacrilege; bold men, who feared nothing that men could do to them, and
  who dared in the king's own presence, and in his own chapel, to denounce
  him by name.<a name="NtA_360"></a><a href="#Nt_360"><sup>360</sup></a>
  The sacred associations of twelve centuries were tumbling into ruin; and
  hot and angry as men had been before the work began, the hearts of
  numbers sank in them when they "saw what was done;" and they fell away
  slowly to doubt, disaffection, distrust, and at last treason.</p>

  <p>The first outward symptom of importance pointing in this direction,
  was the resignation of the seals by Sir Thomas More.<a
  name="NtA_361"></a><a href="#Nt_361"><sup>361</sup></a> <!-- Page 222
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>[pg 222]</span> More had
  not been an illiberal man; when he wrote the <i>Utopia</i>, he seemed
  even to be in advance of his time. None could see the rogue's face under
  the cowl clearer than he, or the proud bad heart under the scarlet hat;
  and few men had ventured to speak their thoughts more boldly. But there
  was in More a want of confidence in human nature, a scorn of the follies
  of his fellow creatures which, as he became more earnestly religious,
  narrowed and hardened his convictions, and transformed the genial
  philosopher into the merciless bigot. "Heresy" was naturally hateful to
  him; his mind was too clear and genuine to allow him to deceive himself
  with the delusions of Anglicanism; and as he saw the inevitable tendency
  of the Reformation to lead ultimately to a change of doctrine, he
  attached himself with increasing determination to the cause of the pope
  and of the old faith. As if with an instinctive prescience of what would
  follow from it, he had from the first been opposed to the divorce; and he
  had not concealed his feeling from the king at the time when the latter
  had pressed the seals on his unwilling acceptance. In consenting to
  become chancellor, he had yielded only to Henry's entreaties; he had held
  his office for two years and a half&mdash;and it would have been well for
  his memory if he had been constant in his refusal&mdash;for in his
  ineffectual struggles against the stream, he had attempted to
  counterpoise the attack upon the church by destroying the unhappy
  Protestants. At the close of the session, however, the acts of which we
  have just described, he felt that he must no longer countenance, by
  remaining in an office so near to the crown, measures which he so
  intensely disapproved and deplored; it was time for him to retire from a
  world not moving to his mind; and in the fair tranquillity of his family
  prepare himself for the evil days which he foresaw. In May, 1532, he
  petitioned for permission to resign, resting his request unobtrusively on
  failing health; and Henry sadly consented to lose his services.</p>

  <p>Parallel to More's retirement, and though less important, yet still
  noticeable, is a proceeding of old Archbishop Warham under the same
  trying circumstances. In the days of his prosperity, Warham had never
  reached to greatness as a man. He had <!-- Page 223 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span> been a great
  ecclesiastic, successful, dignified, important, but without those highest
  qualities which command respect or interest. The iniquities of Warham's
  spiritual courts were greater than those of any other in England. He had
  not made them what they were. They grew by their own proper corruption;
  and he was no more responsible for them than every man is responsible for
  the continuance of an evil by which he profits, and which he has power to
  remedy. We must look upon him as the leader of the bishops in their
  opposition to the reform; and he was the probable author of the famous
  answer to the Commons' petition, which led to such momentous
  consequences.<a name="NtA_362"></a><a href="#Nt_362"><sup>362</sup></a>
  These consequences he had lived partially to see. Powerless to struggle
  against the stream, he had seen swept away one by one those gigantic
  privileges to which he had asserted for his order a claim divinely
  sanctioned; and he withdrew himself heartbroken, into his palace at
  Lambeth, and there entered his solemn protest against all which had been
  done. Too ill to write, and trembling on the edge of the grave, he
  dictated to his notaries from his bed these not unaffecting
  words:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In the name of God, Amen. We, William, by Divine Providence
  Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England, Legate of the Apostolic
  See, hereby publicly and expressly do protest for ourselves and for our
  Holy Metropolitan Church of Canterbury, that to any statute passed or
  hereafter to be passed in this present Parliament, began the third of
  November, 1529, and continued until this present time; in so far as such
  statute or statutes be in derogation of the Pope of Rome or the Apostolic
  See, or be to the hurt, prejudice, or limitation of the powers of the
  Church, or shall tend to the subverting, enervating, derogating from, or
  diminishing the laws, customs, privileges, prerogatives, pre-eminence of
  liberties of our Metropolitan Church of Canterbury; we neither will, nor
  intend, nor with clear conscience are able to consent to the same, but by
  these writings we do dissent from, refuse, and contradict them."<a
  name="NtA_363"></a><a href="#Nt_363"><sup>363</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus formally having delivered his soul, he laid himself down and
  died.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>MARRIAGE OF HENRY AND ANNE BOLEYN</h3>

  <p>Although in the question of the divorce the king had interfered
  despotically to control the judgment of the universities, he had made no
  attempt, as we have seen, to check the tongues of the clergy. Nor if he
  had desired to check them, is it likely that at the present stage of
  proceedings he could have succeeded. No law had as yet been passed which
  made a crime of a difference of opinion on the pope's dispensing powers;
  and so long as no definitive sentence had been pronounced, every one had
  free liberty to think and speak as he pleased. So great, indeed, was the
  anxiety to disprove Catherine's assertion that England was a <i>locus
  suspectus</i>, and therefore that the cause could not be equitably tried
  there, that even in the distribution of patronage there was an
  ostentatious display of impartiality. Not only had Sir Thomas More been
  made chancellor, although emphatically on Catherine's side; but Cuthbert
  Tunstal, who had been her counsel, was promoted to the see of Durham. The
  Nun of Kent, if her word was to be believed, had been offered an abbey,<a
  name="NtA_364"></a><a href="#Nt_364"><sup>364</sup></a> and that Henry
  permitted language to pass unnoticed of the most uncontrolled violence,
  appears from a multitude of informations which were forwarded to the
  government from all parts of the country. But while imposing no restraint
  on the expression of opinion, the council were careful to keep themselves
  well informed of the opinions which were expressed, and an instrument was
  ready made to their hands, which placed them in easy possession of what
  they desired. Among the many abominable practices which had been
  introduced by the ecclesiastical courts, not the least hateful was the
  system of espionage with which they had saturated English society;
  encouraging servants to be spies on their masters, children on their
  parents, neighbours on their neighbours, inviting every one who heard
  language spoken anywhere of doubtful allegiance to the church, to report
  the words to the nearest official, as an occasion of instant process. It
  is not without a feeling of satisfaction, that we find this detestable
  invention recoiling upon the heads of its authors. Those who had so long
  suffered under it, found an opportunity in the turning tide, of revenging
  themselves <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>[pg 225]</span> on their oppressors; and the country
  was covered with a ready-made army of spies, who, with ears ever open,
  were on the watch for impatient or disaffected language in their clerical
  superiors, and furnished steady reports of such language to Cromwell.<a
  name="NtA_365"></a><a href="#Nt_365"><sup>365</sup></a></p>

  <p>Specimens of these informations will throw curious light on the
  feelings of a portion at least of the people. The English licence of
  speech, if not recognised to the same extent as it is at <!-- Page 226
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>[pg 226]</span> present,
  was certainly as fully practised. On the return of the Abbot of Whitby
  from the convocation at York in the summer of 1532, when the premunire
  money was voted, the following conversation was reported as having been
  overheard in the abbey.</p>

  <p>The prior of the convent asked the abbot what the news were. "What
  news," said the abbot, "evil news. The king is ruled by a common
  &mdash;&mdash; Anne Boleyn, who has made all the spiritualty to be
  beggared, and the temporalty also. Further he told the prior of a sermon
  that he had heard in York, in which it was said, when a great wind rose
  in the west we should hear news. And he asked what that was; and he said
  a great man told him at York, and if he knew as much as three in England
  he would tell what the news were. And he said who were they? and he said
  the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Wiltshire, and the common &mdash;&mdash;
  Anne Boleyn."<a name="NtA_366"></a><a
  href="#Nt_366"><sup>366</sup></a></p>

  <p>The dates of these papers cannot always be determined; this which
  follows, probably, is something later, but it shows the general temper in
  which the clergy were disposed to meet the measures of the
  government.</p>

  <p>"Robert Legate, friar of Furness, deposeth that the monks had a
  prophecy among them, that 'in England shall be slain the decorate rose in
  his mother's belly,' and this they interpret of his Majesty, saying that
  his Majesty shall die by the hands of priests; for the church is the
  mother, and the church shall slay his Grace. The said Robert maintaineth
  that he hath heard the monks often say this. Also, it is said among them
  that the King's Grace was not the right heir to the crown; for that his
  Grace's father came in by no line, but by the sword. Also, that no
  secular knave should be head of the church; also that the abbot did know
  of these treasons, and had made no report thereof."<a
  name="NtA_367"></a><a href="#Nt_367"><sup>367</sup></a></p>

  <p>Nor was it only in the remote abbeys of the North that such dangerous
  language was ventured. The pulpit of St. Paul's rang Sunday after Sunday
  with the polemics of the divorce; and if "the holy water of the court"
  made the higher clergy cringing and cowardly, the rank and file, even in
  London itself, showed a bold English front, and spoke out their thoughts
  with entire recklessness. Among the preachers on Catherine's side, <!--
  Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span>
  Father Forest, famous afterward in Catholic martyrologies, began to
  distinguish himself. Forest was warden of a convent of Observants at
  Greenwich attached to the royal chapel, and having been Catherine's
  confessor, remained, with the majority of the friars, faithful to her
  interests, and fearless in the assertion of them. From their connection
  with the palace, the intercourse of these monks with the royal household
  was considerable; their position gave them influence, and Anne Boleyn
  tried the power of her charms, if possible, to gain them over. She had
  succeeded with a few of the weaker brothers, but she was unable (and her
  inability speaks remarkably for Henry's endurance of opposition through
  the early stages of the controversy) to protect those whose services she
  had won from the anger of their superiors. One monk in whom she was
  interested the warden imprisoned,<a name="NtA_368"></a><a
  href="#Nt_368"><sup>368</sup></a> another there was an effort to expel,<a
  name="NtA_369"></a><a href="#Nt_369"><sup>369</sup></a> because he was
  ready to preach on her side; and Forest himself preached a violent sermon
  at Paul's Cross, attacking Cromwell and indirectly the king.<a
  name="NtA_370"></a><a href="#Nt_370"><sup>370</sup></a> He was sent for
  to the court, and the persecuted brothers expected their triumph; but he
  returned, as one of them wrote bitterly to Cromwell, having been received
  with respect and favour, as if, after all, the enmity of a brave man
  found more honour at the court than the complacency of cowardice. Father
  Forest, says this letter, has been with the king. "He says he spake with
  the king for half an hour and more, and was well retained by his Grace;
  and the King's Grace did send him a great piece of beef from his own
  table; and also he met with my Lord of Norfolk, and he says he took him
  in his arms and bade him welcome."<a name="NtA_371"></a><a
  href="#Nt_371"><sup>371</sup></a></p>

  <p>Forest, unfortunately for himself, misconstrued forbearance into fear,
  and went his way at last, through treason and perjury, to the stake. In
  the meantime the Observants were left in possession of the royal chapel,
  the weak brother died in prison, and the king, when at Greenwich,
  continued to attend service, submitting to listen, as long as submission
  was possible, to the admonitions which the friars used the opportunity to
  deliver to him.</p>

  <p>In these more courteous days we can form little conception <!-- Page
  228 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span> of the
  licence which preachers in the sixteenth century allowed themselves, or
  the language which persons in high authority were often obliged to bear.
  Latimer spoke as freely to Henry VIII. of neglected duties, as to the
  peasants in his Wiltshire parish. St. Ambrose did not rebuke the Emperor
  Theodosius more haughtily than John Knox lectured Queen Mary and her
  ministers on the vanities of Holyrood; and Catholic priests, it seems,
  were not afraid to display even louder disrespect.</p>

  <p>On Sunday, the first of May, 1532, the pulpit at Greenwich was
  occupied by Father Peto, afterwards Cardinal Peto, famous through Europe
  as a Catholic incendiary; but at this time an undistinguished brother of
  the Observants convent. His sermon had been upon the story of Ahab and
  Naboth, and his text had been, "Where the dogs licked the blood of
  Naboth, even there shall they lick thy blood, O king." Henry, the court,
  and most likely Anne Boleyn herself, were present; the first of May being
  the great holy-day of the English year, and always observed at Greenwich
  with peculiar splendour.  The preacher had dilated at length upon the
  crimes and the fall of Ahab, and had drawn the portrait in all its
  magnificent wickedness.  He had described the scene in the court of
  heaven, and spoken of the lying prophets who had mocked the monarch's
  hopes before the fatal battle. At the end, he turned directly to Henry,
  and assuming to himself the mission of Micaiah, he closed his address in
  the following audacious words:&mdash;"And now, O king," he said, "hear
  what I say to thee.  I am that Micaiah whom thou wilt hate, because I
  must tell thee truly that this marriage is unlawful, and I know that I
  shall eat the bread of affliction and drink the waters of sorrow, yet
  because the Lord hath put it in my mouth I must speak it.  There are
  other preachers, yea too many, which preach and persuade thee otherwise,
  feeding they folly and frail affections upon hopes of their own worldly
  promotion; and by that means they betray thy soul, thy honour, and thy
  posterity; to obtain fat benefices, to become rich abbots and bishops,
  and I know not what.  These I say are the four hundred prophets who, in
  the spirit of lying, seek to deceive thee.  Take heed lest thou, being
  seduced, find Ahab's punishment, who had his blood licked up by the
  dogs."</p>

  <p>Henry must have been compelled to listen to many such invectives. He
  left the chapel without noticing what had passed; and in the course of
  the week Peto went down from Greenwich to attend a provincial council at
  Canterbury, and perhaps to <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span> communicate with the Nun of Kent.
  Meantime a certain Dr. Kirwan was commissioned to preach on the other
  side of the question the following Sunday.</p>

  <p>Kirwan was one of those men of whom the preacher spoke prophetically,
  since by the present and similar services he made his way to the
  archbishopric of Dublin and the bishopric of Oxford, and accepting the
  Erastian theory of a Christian's duty, followed Edward VI. into heresy,
  and Mary into popery and persecution. He regarded himself as an official
  of the state religion; and his highest conception of evil in a Christian
  was disobedience to the reigning authority. We may therefore conceive
  easily the burden of his sermon in the royal chapel. "He most sharply
  reprehended Peto," calling him foul names, "dog, slanderer, base beggarly
  friar, rebel, and traitor," saying "that no subject should speak so
  audaciously to his prince:" he "commended" Henry's intended marriage,
  "thereby to establish his seed in his seat for ever;" and having won, as
  he supposed, his facile victory, he proceeded with his peroration,
  addressing his absent antagonist. "I speak to thee, Peto," he exclaimed,
  "to thee, Peto, which makest thyself Micaiah, that thou mayest speak evil
  of kings; but now art not to be found, being fled for fear and shame, as
  unable to answer my argument." In the royal chapel at Greenwich there was
  more reality than decorum. A voice out of the rood-loft cut short the
  eloquent declamation. "Good sir," it said, "you know Father Peto is gone
  to Canterbury to a provincial council, and not fled for fear of you; for
  to-morrow he will return again. In the meantime I am here as another
  Micaiah, and will lay down my life to prove those things true which he
  hath taught. And to this combat I challenge thee; thee Kirwan, I say, who
  art one of the four hundred into whom the spirit of lying is entered, and
  thou seekest by adultery to establish the succession, betraying thy king
  for thy own vain glory into endless perdition."</p>

  <p>A scene of confusion followed, which was allayed at last by the king
  himself, who rose from his seat and commanded silence. It was thought
  that the limit of permissible licence had been transcended, and the
  following day Peto and Elstowe, the other speaker, were summoned before
  the council to receive a reprimand. Lord Essex told them they deserved to
  be sewn into a sack and thrown into the Thames. "Threaten such things to
  rich and dainty folk, which have their hope in this world," answered
  Elstowe, gallantly, "we fear them not; with thanks to God we know the way
  to heaven to be as ready by water as <!-- Page 230 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span> by land."<a
  name="NtA_372"></a><a href="#Nt_372"><sup>372</sup></a> Men of such metal
  might be broken, but they could not be bent. The two offenders were
  hopelessly unrepentant and impracticable, and it was found necessary to
  banish them. They retired to Antwerp, where we find them the following
  year busy procuring copies of the Bishop of Rochester's book against the
  king, which was broadly disseminated on the continent, and secretly
  transmitting them into England; in close correspondence also with Fisher
  himself, with Sir Thomas More, and for the ill fortune of their friends,
  with the court at Brussels, between which and the English Catholics the
  intercourse was dangerously growing.<a name="NtA_373"></a><a
  href="#Nt_373"><sup>373</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Greenwich friars, with their warden, went also a bad way. The
  death of the persecuted brother was attended with circumstances in a high
  degree suspicious.<a name="NtA_374"></a><a
  href="#Nt_374"><sup>374</sup></a> Henry ordered an enquiry, which did not
  terminate in any actual exposure; but a cloud hung over the convent,
  which refused to be dispelled; the warden was deposed, and soon after it
  was found necessary to dissolve the order.</p>

  <p>If the English monks had shared as a body the character of the
  Greenwich Observants, of the Carthusians of London and Richmond, and of
  some other establishments,&mdash;which may easily be numbered,&mdash;the
  resistance which they might have offered to the government, with the
  sympathy which it would have commanded, would have formed an obstacle to
  the Reformation <!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span> that no power could have overcome. It
  was time, however, for the dissolution of the monasteries, when the few
  among them, which on other grounds might have claimed a right to survive,
  were driven by their very virtues into treason. The majority perished of
  their proper worthlessness; the few remaining contrived to make their
  existence incompatible with the safety of the state.</p>

  <p>Leaving for the present these disorders to mature themselves, I must
  now return to the weary chapter of European diplomacy, to trace the
  tortuous course of popes and princes, duping one another with false
  hopes; saying what they did not mean, and meaning what they did not say.
  It is a very Slough of Despond, through which we must plunge desperately
  as we may; and we can cheer ourselves in this dismal region only by the
  knowledge that, although we are now approaching the spot where the mire
  is deepest, the hard ground is immediately beyond.</p>

  <p>We shall, perhaps, be able most readily to comprehend the position of
  the various parties in Europe, by placing them before us as they stood
  severally in the summer of 1532, and defining briefly the object which
  each was pursuing.</p>

  <p>Henry only, among the great powers, laid his conduct open to the
  world, declaring truly what he desired, and seeking it by open means. He
  was determined to proceed with the divorce, and he was determined also to
  continue the Reformation of the English Church. If consistently with
  these two objects he could avoid a rupture with the pope, he was
  sincerely anxious to avoid it. He was ready to make great efforts, to
  risk great sacrifices, to do anything short of surrendering what he
  considered of vital moment, to remain upon good terms with the See of
  Rome. If his efforts failed, and a quarrel was inevitable, he desired to
  secure himself by a close maintenance of the French alliance; and having
  induced Francis to urge compliance upon the pope by a threat of
  separation if he refused, to prevail on him, in the event of the pope's
  continued obstinacy, to put his threat in execution, and unite with
  England in a common schism. All this is plain and
  straightforward&mdash;Henry concealed nothing, and, in fact, had nothing
  to conceal. In his threats, his promises, and his entreaties, we feel
  entire certainty that he was speaking his real thoughts.</p>

  <p>The emperor's position, also, though not equally simple, is
  intelligible, and commands our respect. Although if he had consented to
  sacrifice his aunt, he might have spared himself serious embarrassment;
  although both by the pope and by the <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span> consistory such a
  resolution would probably have been welcomed with passionate
  thankfulness; yet at all hazards Charles was determined to make her his
  first object, even with the risk of convulsing Europe. At the same time
  his position was encumbered with difficulty. The Turks were pressing upon
  him in Hungary and in the Mediterranean; his relations with
  Francis&mdash;fortunately for the prospects of the Reformation&mdash;were
  those of inveterate hostility; while in Germany he had been driven to
  make terms with the Protestant princes; he had offended the pope by
  promising them a general council, in which the Lutheran divines should be
  represented; and the pope, taught by recent experience, was made to fear
  that these symptoms of favour towards heresy, might convert themselves
  into open support.</p>

  <p>With Francis the prevailing feeling was rivalry with the emperor,
  combined with an eager desire to recover his influence in Italy, and to
  restore France to the position in Europe which had been lost by the
  defeat of Pavia, and the failure of Lautrec at Naples. This was his first
  object, to which every other was subsidiary. He was disinclined to a
  rupture with the pope; but the possibility of such a rupture had been
  long contemplated by French statesmen. It was a contingency which the
  pope feared:&mdash;which the hopes of Henry pictured as more likely than
  it was&mdash;and Francis, like his rivals in the European system, held
  the menace of it extended over the chair of St. Peter, to coerce its
  unhappy occupant into compliance with his wishes. With respect to Henry's
  divorce, his conduct to the University of Paris, and his assurances
  repeated voluntarily on many occasions, show that he was sincerely
  desirous to forward it. He did not care for Henry, or for England, or for
  the cause itself; he desired only to make the breach between Henry and
  Charles irreparable; to make it impossible for ever that "his two great
  rivals" should become friends together; and by inducing the pope to
  consent to the English demand, to detach the court of Rome conclusively
  from the imperial interests.</p>

  <p>The two princes who disputed the supremacy of Europe, were intriguing
  one against the other, each desiring to constitute himself the champion
  of the church; and to compel the church to accept his services, by the
  threat of passing over to her enemies. By a dexterous use of the cards
  which were in his hands, the King of France proposed to secure one of two
  alternatives. Either he would form a league between himself, Henry, and
  the pope, against the emperor, of which the divorce, and the consent to
  it, which he would extort from Clement, should be the cement; <!-- Page
  233 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span> or, if
  this failed him, he would avail himself of the vantage ground which was
  given to him by the English alliance to obtain such concessions for
  himself at the emperor's expense as the pope could be induced to make,
  and the emperor to tolerate.</p>

  <p>Such, in so far as I can unravel the web of the diplomatic
  correspondence, appear to have been the open positions and the secret
  purposes of the great European powers.</p>

  <p>There remains the fourth figure upon the board, the pope himself,
  labouring with such means as were at his disposal to watch over the
  interests of the church, and to neutralise the destructive ambition of
  the princes, by playing upon their respective selfishnesses. On the
  central question, that of the divorce, his position was briefly this.
  Both the emperor and Henry pressed for a decision. If he decided for
  Henry, he lost Germany; if he decided for Catherine, while Henry was
  supported by Francis, France and England threatened both to fall from
  him. It was therefore necessary for him to induce the emperor to consent
  to delay, while he worked upon the King of France; and, if France and
  England could once be separated, he trusted that Henry would yield in
  despair. This most subtle and difficult policy reveals itself in the
  transactions open and secret of the ensuing years. It was followed with a
  dexterity as extraordinary as its unscrupulousness, and with all but
  perfect success. That it failed at all, in the ordinary sense of failure,
  was due to the accidental delay of a courier; and Clement, while he
  succeeded in preserving the allegiance of France to the Roman see,
  succeeded also&mdash;and this is no small thing to have
  accomplished&mdash;in weaving the most curious tissue of falsehood which
  will be met with even in the fertile pages of Italian subtlety.</p>

  <p>With this general understanding of the relation between the great
  parties in the drama, let us look to their exact position in the summer
  of 1532.</p>

  <p>Charles was engaged in repelling an invasion of the Turks, with an
  anarchical Germany in his rear, seething with fanatical anabaptists, and
  clamouring for a general council.</p>

  <p>Henry and Francis had been called upon to furnish a contingent against
  Solyman, and had declined to act with the emperor. They had undertaken to
  concert their own measures between themselves, if it proved necessary for
  them to move; and in the meantime Cardinal Grammont and Cardinal Tournon
  were sent by Francis to Rome, to inform Clement that unless he gave a
  verdict in Henry's favour, the Kings of France and England, <!-- Page 234
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>[pg 234]</span> being
  <i>une mesme chose</i>, would pursue some policy with respect to him,<a
  name="NtA_375"></a><a href="#Nt_375"><sup>375</sup></a> to which he would
  regret that he had compelled them to <!-- Page 235 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span> have recourse. So
  far their instructions were avowed and open. A private message revealed
  the secret means by which the pope might escape from his dilemma; the
  cardinals were to negotiate a marriage between the Duke of Orleans and
  the pope's niece (afterwards so infamously famous), Catherine de Medicis.
  The marriage, as Francis represented it to Henry, was beneath the dignity
  of a prince of France, he had consented to it, as he professed, only for
  Henry's sake;<a name="NtA_376"></a><a href="#Nt_376"><sup>376</sup></a>
  but the pope had made it palatable by a secret article in the engagement,
  for the grant of the duchy of Milan as the lady's dowry.</p>

  <p>Henry, threatened as we have seen with domestic disturbance, and with
  further danger on the side of Scotland, which Charles had succeeded in
  agitating, concluded, on the 23rd of June, a league, offensive and
  defensive, with Francis, the latter engaging to send a fleet into the
  Channel, and to land 15,000 troops in England if the emperor should
  attempt an invasion from the sea.<a name="NtA_378"></a><a
  href="#Nt_378"><sup>378</sup></a> For the better consolidation of this
  league, and to consult upon the measures which they would pursue on the
  great questions at issue in Christendom, and lastly to come to a final
  understanding on the divorce, it was agreed further that in the autumn
  the two kings should meet at Calais. The conditions of the interview were
  still unarranged on the 22nd of July, when the Bishop of Paris, who
  remained ambassador at the English court, wrote to Montmorency to suggest
  that Anne Boleyn should be invited to accompany the King of England on
  this occasion, and that she should be received in state. The letter was
  dated from Ampthill, to which Henry had escaped for a while from his
  Greenwich friars and other troubles, and where the king was staying a few
  weeks before the house was given up to Queen Catherine. Anne Boleyn was
  with him; she now, as a matter of course, attended him everywhere.
  Intending her, as he did, to be the mother of the future heir to his
  crown, he <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span> preserved what is technically called
  her honour unimpeached and unimpaired. In all other respects she occupied
  the position and received the homage due to the actual wife of the
  English sovereign; and in this capacity it was the desire of Henry that
  she should be acknowledged by a foreign prince.</p>

  <p>The bishop's letter on this occasion is singularly interesting and
  descriptive. The court were out hunting, he said, every day; and while
  the king was pursuing the heat of the chase, he and Mademoiselle Anne
  were posted together, each with a crossbow, at the point to which the
  deer was to be driven. The young lady, in order that the appearance of
  her reverend cavalier might correspond with his occupation, had made him
  a present of a hunting cap and frock, a horn and a greyhound. Her
  invitation to Calais he pressed with great earnestness, and suggested
  that Marguerite de Valois, the Queen of Navarre, should be brought down
  to entertain her. The Queen of France being a Spaniard, would not, he
  thought, be welcome: "the sight of a Spanish dress being as hateful in
  the King of England's eyes as the devil himself." In other respects the
  reception should be as magnificent as possible, "and I beseech you," he
  concluded, "keep out of the court, <i>deux sortes de gens</i>, the
  imperialists, and the wits and mockers; the English can endure neither of
  them."<a name="NtA_379"></a><a href="#Nt_379"><sup>379</sup></a></p>

  <p>Through the tone of this language the contempt is easily <!-- Page 237
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span> visible
  with which the affair was regarded in the French court. But for Francis
  to receive in public the rival of Queen Catherine, to admit her into his
  family, and to bring his sister from Paris to entertain her, was to
  declare in the face of Europe, in a manner which would leave no doubt of
  his sincerity, that he intended to countenance Henry. With this view only
  was the reception of Anne desired by the King of England; with this view
  it was recommended by the bishop, and assented to by the French court.
  Nor was this the only proof which Francis was prepared to give, that he
  was in earnest. He had promised to distribute forty thousand crowns at
  Rome, in bribing cardinals to give their voices for Henry in the
  consistory, with other possible benefactions.<a name="NtA_380"></a><a
  href="#Nt_380"><sup>380</sup></a></p>

  <p>He had further volunteered his good offices with the court of
  Scotland, where matters were growing serious, and where his influence
  could be used to great advantage. The ability of James the Fifth to
  injure Henry happily fell short of his inclination, but encouraged by
  secret promises from Clement and from the emperor, he was waiting his
  opportunity to cross the Border with an army; and in the meantime he was
  feeding with efficient support a rebellion in Ireland. Of what was
  occurring at this time in that perennially miserable country I shall
  speak in a separate chapter. It is here sufficient to mention, that on
  the 23rd of August, Henry received information that McConnell of the
  Isles, after receiving knighthood from James, had been despatched into
  Ulster with four thousand men,<a name="NtA_381"></a><a
  href="#Nt_381"><sup>381</sup></a> and was followed by Mackane with seven
  thousand more on the 3rd of September.<a name="NtA_382"></a><a
  href="#Nt_382"><sup>382</sup></a> Peace with England nominally continued;
  but <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>[pg
  238]</span> the Kers, the Humes, the Scotts of Buccleugh, the advanced
  guard of the Marches, were nightly making forays across the Border, and
  open hostilities appeared to be on the point of explosion.<a
  name="NtA_383"></a><a href="#Nt_383"><sup>383</sup></a> If war was to
  follow, Henry was prepared for it. He had a powerful force at Berwick,
  and in Scotland itself a large party were secretly attached to the
  English interests. The clan of Douglas, with their adherents, were even
  prepared for open revolt, and open transfer of allegiance.<a
  name="NtA_384"></a><a href="#Nt_384"><sup>384</sup></a> But, although
  Scottish nobles might be gained over, and Scottish armies might be
  defeated in the field, Scotland itself, as the experience of centuries
  had proved, could never be conquered. The policy of the Tudors had been
  to abstain from aggression, till time should have soothed down the
  inherited animosity between the two countries; and Henry was unwilling to
  be forced into extremities which might revive the bitter memories of
  Flodden. The Northern counties also, in spite of their Border prejudices,
  were the stronghold of the papal party, and it was doubtful how far their
  allegiance could be counted upon in the event of an invasion sanctioned
  by the pope. The hands of the English government were already full
  without superadded embarrassment, and the offered mediation of Francis
  was gratefully welcomed.</p>

  <p>These were the circumstances under which the second great interview
  was to take place between Francis the First and Henry of England.<a
  name="NtA_385"></a><a href="#Nt_385"><sup>385</sup></a> Twelve years had
  passed since their last meeting, <!-- Page 239 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span> and the experience
  which those years had brought to both of them, had probably subdued their
  inclination for splendid pageantry. Nevertheless, in honour of the
  occasion, some faint revival was attempted of the magnificence of the
  Field of the Cloth of Gold. Anne Boleyn was invited duly; and the Queen
  of Navarre, as the Bishop of Paris recommended, came down to Boulogne to
  receive her. The French princes came also to thank Henry in person for
  their deliverance out of their Spanish prison; and he too, on his side,
  brought with him his young Marcellus, the Duke of Richmond, his only
  son&mdash;illegitimate unfortunately&mdash;but whose beauty and noble
  promise were at once his father's misery and pride; giving point to his
  bitterness at the loss of his sons by Catherine; quickening his hopes of
  what might be, and deepening his discontent with <!-- Page 240 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span> that which was. If
  this boy had lived, he would have been named to follow Edward the Sixth
  in the succession, and would have been King of England;<a
  name="NtA_386"></a><a href="#Nt_386"><sup>386</sup></a> but he too passed
  away in the flower of his loveliness, one more evidence of the blight
  which rested upon the stem of the Tudors.</p>

  <p>The English court was entertained by Francis at Boulogne. The French
  court was received in return at Calais by the English. The outward
  description of the scene, the magnificent train of <!-- Page 241 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span> the princes, the
  tournaments, the feasts, the dances, will be found minutely given in the
  pages of Hall, and need not be repeated here. To Hall indeed, the outward
  life of men, their exploits in war, and their pageantries in peace, alone
  had meaning or interest; and the backstairs secrets of Vatican diplomacy,
  the questionings of opinion, and all the brood of mental sicknesses then
  beginning to distract the world, were but impertinent interferences with
  the true business of existence. But the healthy objectiveness of an old
  English chronicler is no longer possible for us; we may envy where we
  cannot imitate; and our business is with such features of the story as
  are of moment to ourselves.</p>

  <p>The political questions which were to be debated at the conference,
  were three; the Turkish Invasion, the General Council, and King Henry's
  divorce.</p>

  <p>On the first, it was decided that there was no immediate occasion for
  France and England to move. Solyman's retreat from Vienna had relieved
  Europe from present peril; and the enormous losses which he had suffered,
  might prevent him from repeating the experiment. If the danger became
  again imminent, however, the two kings agreed to take the field in person
  the following year at the head of eighty thousand men.</p>

  <p>On the second point they came to no conclusion, but resolved only to
  act in common.</p>

  <p>On the third and most important, they parted with a belief that they
  understood each other; but their memories, or the memory of one of them,
  proved subsequently treacherous; and we can only extract what passed
  between them out of their mutual recriminations.</p>

  <p>It was determined certainly that at the earliest convenient moment, a
  meeting should take place between the pope and Francis; and that at this
  meeting Francis should urge in person concession to Henry's demands. If
  the pope professed himself unable to risk the displeasure of the emperor,
  it should be suggested that he might return to Avignon, where he would be
  secure under the protection of France and England. If he was still
  reluctant, and persisted in asserting his right to compel Henry to plead
  before him at Rome, or if he followed up his citations by inhibitions,
  suspensions, excommunications, or other form of censure, Francis declared
  that he would support Henry to the last, whether against the pope himself
  or against any prince or potentate who might attempt to enforce the
  sentence. On this point the promises of the King of France <!-- Page 242
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span> were most
  profuse and decided; and although it was not expressly stated in words,
  Henry seems to have persuaded himself that, if the pope pressed matters
  to extremities, Francis had engaged further that the two countries should
  pursue a common course, and unite in a common schism. The two princes did
  in fact agree, that if the general council which they desired was
  refused, they would summon provincial councils on their own authority.
  Each of them perhaps interpreted their engagements by their own wishes or
  interests.<a name="NtA_387"></a><a href="#Nt_387"><sup>387</sup></a></p>

  <p>We may further believe, since it was affirmed by Henry, and not denied
  by Francis, that the latter advised Henry to bring the dispute to a
  close, by a measure from which he could not recede; that he recommended
  him to act on the general opinion of Europe that his marriage with Queen
  Catherine was null, and at once upon his return to England to make Anne
  Boleyn his wife.<a name="NtA_388"></a><a
  href="#Nt_388"><sup>388</sup></a></p>

  <p>So far the account is clear. This advice was certainly given, and as
  certainly Francis undertook to support Henry through all the consequences
  in which the marriage might involve him. But a league for mutual defence
  fell short of what Henry desired, and fell short also of what Francis, by
  the warmth of his manner, had induced Henry for the moment to believe
  that he meant. It is probable that the latter pressed upon him
  engagements which he avoided by taking refuge in general professions; and
  no sooner had Henry returned to England, <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span> than either
  misgivings occurred to him as to the substantial results of the
  interview, or he was anxious to make the French king commit himself more
  definitely. He sent to him to beg that he would either write out, or
  dictate and sign, the expressions which he had used; professing to wish
  it only for the comfort which he would derive from the continual presence
  of such refreshing words&mdash;but surely for some deeper reason.<a
  name="NtA_389"></a><a href="#Nt_389"><sup>389</sup></a></p>

  <p>Francis had perhaps said more than he meant; Henry supposed him to
  have meant more than he said. Yet some promise was made, which was not
  afterwards observed; and Francis acknowledged some engagement in an
  apology which he offered for the breach of it. He asserted, in defence of
  himself, that he had added a stipulation which Henry passed over in
  silence,&mdash;that no steps should be taken towards annulling the
  marriage with Catherine in the English law courts until the effect had
  been seen of his interview with the pope, provided the pope on his side
  remained similarly inactive.<a name="NtA_390"></a><a
  href="#Nt_390"><sup>390</sup></a> Whatever it was which he had bound
  himself to do, this condition, if made at all, could be reconciled only
  with his advice that Henry should marry Anne Boleyn without further
  delay, on the supposition that the interview in question was to take
  place immediately; for the natural consequences of the second marriage
  would involve, as a matter of course, some speedy legal declaration with
  respect to the first. And when on various pretexts the pope postponed the
  meeting, and on the other part of his suggestion Henry had acted within a
  few months of his return from Calais, it became impossible that such a
  condition could be observed. It availed for a formal excuse; but Francis
  vainly endeavoured to disguise his own infirmity of purpose behind the
  language of a negotiation which conveyed, when it was used, a meaning
  widely different.</p>

<!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>[pg 244]</span>

  <p>The conference was concluded on the 1st of November, but the court was
  detained at Calais for a further fortnight by violent gales in the
  Channel. In the excited state of public feeling, events in themselves
  ordinary assumed a preternatural significance. The friends of Queen
  Catherine, to whom the meeting between the kings was of so disastrous
  augury, and the nation generally, which an accident to Henry at such a
  time would have plunged into a chaos of confusion, alike watched the
  storm with anxious agitation; on the king's return to London, Te Deums
  were offered in the churches, as if for his deliverance from some extreme
  and imminent peril. The Nun of Kent on this great occasion was admitted
  to conferences with angels. She denounced the meeting, under celestial
  instruction, as a conspiracy against Heaven. The king, she said, but for
  her interposition, would have proceeded, while at Calais, to his impious
  marriage;<a name="NtA_391"></a><a href="#Nt_391"><sup>391</sup></a> and
  God was so angry with him, that he was not permitted to profane with his
  unholy eyes the blessed Sacrament. "It was written in her revelations,"
  says the statute of her attainder, "that when the King's Grace was at
  Calais, and his Majesty and the French king were hearing mass in the
  Church of Our Lady, that God was so displeased with the King's Highness,
  that his Grace saw not at that time the blessed sacrament in the form of
  bread, for it was taken away from the priest, being at mass, by an angel,
  and was ministered to the said Elizabeth, there being present and
  invisible, <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> and suddenly conveyed and rapt thence
  again into the nunnery where she was professed."<a name="NtA_392"></a><a
  href="#Nt_392"><sup>392</sup></a></p>

  <p>She had an interview with Henry on his return through Canterbury, to
  try the effect of her Cassandra presence on his fears;<a
  name="NtA_393"></a><a href="#Nt_393"><sup>393</sup></a> but if he still
  delayed his marriage, it was probably neither because he was frightened
  by her denunciations, nor from alarm at the usual occurrence of an
  equinoctial storm. Many motives combined to dissuade him from further
  hesitation. Six years of trifling must have convinced him that by
  decisive action alone he could force the pope to a conclusion. He was
  growing old, and the exigencies of the succession, rendered doubly
  pressing by the long agitation, required immediate resolution. He was
  himself satisfied that he was at liberty to marry whom he pleased and
  when he pleased, his relationship to Catherine, according to his recent
  convictions, being such as had rendered his connection with her from the
  beginning invalid and void. His own inclinations and the interests of the
  nation pointed to the same course. The King of France had advised it.
  Even the pope himself, at the outset of the discussion, had advised it
  also. "Marry freely," the pope had said; "fear nothing, and all shall be
  arranged as you desire." He had forborne to take the pope at his word; he
  had hoped that the justice of his demands might open a less violent way
  to him; and he had shrunk from a step which might throw even a causeless
  shadow over the legitimacy of the offspring for which he longed. The case
  was now changed; no other alternative seemed to be open to his choice,
  and it was necessary to bring the matter to a close once and for all.</p>

  <p>But Henry, as he said himself, was past the age when passion or
  appetite would be likely to move him, and having waited so many years, he
  could afford to wait a little longer, till the effects of the Calais
  conferences upon the pope should have had time to show themselves. In
  December, Clement was to meet the emperor at Bologna. In the month
  following, it might be hoped that he would meet Francis at Marseilles or
  Avignon, and from their interview would be seen conclusively the future
  attitude of the papal and imperial courts. Experience of the past forbade
  anything like sanguine expectation; yet it was not impossible that the
  pope might be compelled at last to yield the required concessions. The
  terms of Henry's understanding with Francis were not perhaps made public,
  but he <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>[pg
  246]</span> was allowed to dictate the language which the French
  cardinals were to make use of in the consistory;<a name="NtA_394"></a><a
  href="#Nt_394"><sup>394</sup></a> and the reception of Anne Boleyn by the
  French king was equivalent to the most emphatic declaration that if the
  censures of the church were attempted in defence of Catherine, the
  enforcement of them would be resisted by the combined arms of France and
  England.</p>

  <p>And the pope did in fact feel himself in a dilemma from which all his
  address was required to extricate him. He had no support from his
  conscience, for he knew that he was acting unjustly in refusing the
  divorce; while to risk the emperor's anger, which was the only honest
  course before him, was perhaps for that very reason impossible. He fell
  back upon his Italian cunning, and it did not fail him in his need. But
  his conduct, though creditable to his ingenuity, reflects less pleasantly
  on his character; and when it is traced through all its windings, few
  reasonable persons will think that they have need to blush at the causes
  which led to the last breach between England and the papacy.</p>

  <p>From the time of Catherine's appeal and the retirement of Campeggio,
  Clement, with rare exceptions, had maintained an attitude of impassive
  reserve. He had allowed judgment to be delayed on various pretexts,
  because until that time delay had answered his purposes sufficiently. But
  to the English agents he had been studiously cold, not condescending even
  to hold out hopes to them that concession might be possible. Some little
  time before the meeting at Calais, however, a change was observed in the
  language both of the pope himself and of the consistory. The cardinals
  were visibly afraid of the position which had been taken by the French
  king; questions supposed to be closed were once more admitted to debate
  in a manner which seemed to show that their resolution was wavering; and
  one day, at the close of a long argument, the following curious
  conversation took place between some person (Sir Gregory Cassalis,
  apparently), who reported it to Henry, and Clement himself. "I had
  desired a private interview with his Holiness," says the writer,
  "intending to use all my endeavours to persuade him to satisfy your
  Majesty. But although I did my best, I could obtain nothing from him; he
  had an answer for everything which I advanced, and it was in vain that I
  laboured to remove his difficulties. At length, however, in reply to
  something which I had proposed, he said shortly,&mdash;Multo minus <!--
  Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span>
  scandalosum fuisset dispensare cum majestate vestrâ super duabus
  uxoribus, quam ea cedere quæ ego petebam, <i>it would have created less
  scandal to have granted your Majesty a dispensation to have two wives
  than to concede what I was then demanding</i>. As I did not know how far
  this alternative would be pleasing to your Majesty, I endeavoured to
  divert him from it, and to lead him back to what I had been previously
  saying. He was silent for a while, and then, paying no regard to my
  interruption, he continued to speak of the 'two wives,' admitting however
  that there were difficulties in the way of such an arrangement,
  principally it seemed because the emperor would refuse his consent from
  the possible injury which it might create to his cousin's prospects of
  the succession. I replied, that as to the succession, I could not see
  what right the emperor had to a voice upon the matter. If some lawful
  means could be discovered by which your Majesty could furnish yourself
  with male offspring, the emperor could no more justly complain than if
  the queen were to die and the prospects of the princess were interfered
  with by a second marriage of an ordinary kind. To this the pope made no
  answer. I cannot tell what your Majesty will think, nor how far this
  suggestion of the pope would be pleasing to your Majesty. Nor indeed can
  I feel sure, in consequence of what he said about the emperor, that he
  actually would grant the dispensation of which he spoke. I have thought
  it right, however, to inform you of what passed."<a name="NtA_395"></a><a
  href="#Nt_395"><sup>395</sup></a></p>

  <p>This letter is undated, but it was written, as appears from internal
  evidence, some time in the year 1532.<a name="NtA_396"></a><a
  href="#Nt_396"><sup>396</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span>

  <p>The pope's language was ambiguous, and the writer did not allow
  himself to derive from it any favourable augury; but the tone in which
  the suggestions had been made was by many degrees more favourable than
  had been heard for a very long time in the quarter from which they came,
  and the symptoms which it promised of a change of feeling were more than
  confirmed in the following winter.</p>

  <p>Charles was to be at Bologna in the middle of December, where he was
  to discuss with Clement the situation of Europe, and in particular of
  Germany, with the desirableness of fulfilling the engagements into which
  he had entered for a general council.</p>

  <p>This was the avowed object of the meeting. But, however important the
  question of holding a council was becoming, it was not immediately
  pressing; and we cannot doubt that the disquiet occasioned by the
  alliance of England and France was the cause that the conference was held
  at so inconvenient a season. The pope left Rome on the 18th of November,
  having in his train a person who afterwards earned for himself a dark
  name in English history, Dr. Bonner, then a famous canon lawyer attached
  to the embassy. The journey in the wild weather was extremely miserable;
  and Bonner, whose style was as graphic as it was coarse, sent home a
  humorous account of it to Cromwell.<a name="NtA_397"></a><a
  href="#Nt_397"><sup>397</sup></a> Three wretched weeks the party were
  upon the road, plunging through mire and water. They reached Bologna on
  the 8th of December, where, four days after them, arrived Charles V. It
  is important, as we shall presently see, to observe the dates of these
  movements. I shall have to compare with them the successive issues of
  several curious documents. On the 12th of December the pope and the
  emperor met at Bologna; on the 24th Dr. Bennet, Henry's able secretary,
  who had been despatched from England to be present at the conference,
  wrote to report the result of his observations. He had been admitted to
  repeated interviews with the pope, as well before as after the emperor's
  arrival; and the language which the former made use of could only be
  understood, and was of course intended to be <!-- Page 249 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>[pg 249]</span> understood, as
  expressing the attitude in which he was placing himself towards the
  imperial faction. Bennet's letter was as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have been sundry and many times with the pope, as well afore the
  coming of the emperour as sythen, yet I have not at any time found his
  Holiness more tractable or propense to show gratuity unto your Highness
  than now of late,&mdash;insomuch that he hath more freely opened his mind
  than he was accustomed, and said also that he would speak with me frankly
  without any observance or respect at all. At which time, I greatly
  lamented (your Highness's cause being so just) no means could be found
  and taken to satisfy your Highness therein; and I said also that I
  doubted not but that (if his Holiness would) ways might be found by his
  wisdom, now at the emperour's being with him, to satisfy your Highness;
  and that done, his Holiness should not only have your Highness in as much
  or more friendship than he hath had heretofore, but also procure thereby
  that thing which his Holiness hath chiefly desired, which is, as he hath
  said, a universal concord among the princes of Christendom. His Holiness
  answered, that he would it had cost him a joint of his hand that such a
  way might be excogitate; and he said also, that the best thing which he
  could see to be done therein at this present, for a preparation to that
  purpose, was the thing which is contained in the first part of the
  cipher.<a name="NtA_398"></a><a href="#Nt_398"><sup>398</sup></a>
  Speaking of the justness of your cause, he called to his remembrance the
  thing <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>[pg
  250]</span> which he told me two years past; which was, that the opinion
  of the lawyers was more certain, favourable, and helping to your cause
  than the opinion of the divines; for he said that as far as he could
  perceive, the lawyers, though they held quod Papa possit dispensare in
  this case, yet they commonly do agree quod hoc fieri debeat ex maximâ
  causâ, adhibitâ causæ cognitione, which in this case doth not appear; and
  he said, that to come to the truth herein he had used all diligence
  possible, and enquired the opinion of learned men, being of fame and
  indifferency both in the court here and in other places. And his Holiness
  promised me that he would herein use all good policy and dexterity to
  imprint the same in the emperour's head; which done, he reckoneth many
  things to be invented that may be pleasant and profitable to your
  Highness; adding yet that this is not to be done with a fury, but with
  leisure and as occasion shall serve, lest if he should otherwise do, he
  should let and hinder that good effect which peradventure might ensue
  thereby."<a name="NtA_399"></a><a href="#Nt_399"><sup>399</sup></a></p>

  <p>This letter has all the character of truth about it. The secretary had
  no interest in deceiving Henry, and it is quite certain that, whether
  honestly or not, the pope had led him to believe that his sympathies were
  again on the English side, and that he was using his best endeavours to
  subdue the emperor's opposition.</p>

  <p>On the 26th of December, two days later, Sir Gregory Cassalis, who had
  also followed the papal court to Bologna, wrote to the same effect. He,
  too, had been with the pope, who had been very open and confidential with
  him. The emperor, the pope said, had complained of the delay in the
  process, but he had assured him that it was impossible for the consistory
  to do more than it had done. The opinion of the theologians was on the
  whole against the papal power of dispensation in cases of so close
  relationship; of the canon lawyers part agreed with the theologians, and
  those who differed from them were satisfied that such a power might not
  be exercised unless there were most urgent cause, unless, that is, the
  safety of a kingdom were dependent upon it. Such occasion he had declared
  that he could not find to have existed for the dispensation granted by
  his predecessor. The emperor had replied that there had been such
  occasion: the dispensation had been granted to prevent war between Spain
  and England; and that otherwise great calamities would have befallen both
  countries. But this was manifestly untrue; and his Holiness said that he
  had answered, It was a <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span> pity, then, that these causes had not
  been submitted at the time, as the reason for the demand, which it was
  clear that they had not been: as the case stood, it was impossible for
  him to proceed further. Upon which he added, "Se vidisse Cæsarem
  obstupefactum." "I write the words," continued Sir Gregory, "exactly as
  the pope related them to me. Whether he really spoke in this way, I
  cannot tell; of this, however, I am sure, that on the day of our
  conversation he had taken the blessed sacrament. He assured me further,
  that he had laboured to induce the emperor to permit him to satisfy your
  Majesty. I recommended him that when next the emperor spoke with him upon
  the subject, he should enter at greater length on the question of
  <i>justice</i>, and that some other person should be present at the
  conference, that there might be no room left for suspicion."<a
  name="NtA_400"></a><a href="#Nt_400"><sup>400</sup></a></p>

  <p>The manner of Clement was so unlike what Cassalis had been in the
  habit of witnessing in him, that he was unable, as we see, wholly to
  persuade himself that the change was sincere: the letter, however, was
  despatched to England, and was followed in a few days by Bonner, who
  brought with him the result of the pope's good will in the form of
  definite propositions&mdash;instructions of similar purport having been
  forwarded at the same time to the papal nuncio in England. The pope, so
  Henry was informed, was now really well disposed to do what was required;
  he had urged upon the emperor the necessity of concessions, and the cause
  might be settled in one of two ways, to either of which he was himself
  ready to consent. Catherine had appealed against judgment being passed in
  England, as a place which was not indifferent. Henry had refused to allow
  his cause to be heard anywhere but in his own realm; pleading first his
  privilege as a sovereign prince; and secondly, his exemption as an
  Englishman.<a name="NtA_401"></a><a href="#Nt_401"><sup>401</sup></a> The
  pope, with appearance of openness, now suggested that Henry should either
  "send a mandate requiring the remission of his cause to an indifferent
  place, in which case he would himself surrender his claim to have it
  tried in the courts at Rome, and would appoint a legate and two auditors
  to hear the trial elsewhere;" or else, a truce of three or four years
  being concluded between England, France, and Spain, the pope would "with
  all celerity indict a general council, to which he <!-- Page 252 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span> would absolutely
  and wholly remit the consideration of the question."<a
  name="NtA_402"></a><a href="#Nt_402"><sup>402</sup></a></p>

  <p>Both proposals carried on their front a show of fair dealing, and if
  honestly proffered, were an evidence that something more might at length
  be hoped than words. But the true obstacle to a settlement lay, as had
  been long evident, rather in the want of an honest will, than in legal
  difficulties or uncertainty as to the justice of the cause; and while
  neither of the alternatives as they stood were admissible or immediately
  desirable, there were many other roads, if the point of honesty were once
  made good, which would lead more readily to the desired end. Once for all
  Henry could not consent to plead out of England; while an appeal to a
  council would occupy more time than the condition of the country could
  conveniently allow. But the offer had been courteously made; it had been
  accompanied with language which might be sincere; and the king replied
  with grace, and almost with cordiality; not wholly giving Clement his
  confidence, but expressing a hope that he might soon be no longer
  justified in withholding it. He was unable, he said, to accept the first
  condition, because it was contrary to his coronation oath; "it so highly
  touched the prerogative royal of the realm, that though he were minded to
  do it, yet must he abstain without the assent of the court of parliament,
  which he thought verily would never condescend to it."<a
  name="NtA_403"></a><a href="#Nt_403"><sup>403</sup></a> The other
  suggestion he did not absolutely reject, but the gathering of a council
  was too serious a matter to be precipitated, and the situation of
  Christendom presented many obstacles to a measure which would be useless
  unless it were carried through by all the great powers in a spirit of
  cordial unanimity. He trusted therefore that if the pope's intentions
  were really such as he pretended to entertain, he would find some method
  more convenient of proving his sincerity.</p>

  <p>It was happy for Henry that experience had taught him to be
  distrustful. Events proved too clearly that Clement's assumed alteration
  of tone was no more than a man&#339;uvre designed to entice him to
  withdraw from the position in which he had entrenched himself, and to
  induce him to acknowledge that he was amenable to an earthly authority
  exterior to his own realm.<a name="NtA_404"></a><a
  href="#Nt_404"><sup>404</sup></a> In his offer to refer the cause to a
  general council, <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>[pg 253]</span> he proved that he was insincere, when
  in the following year he refused to allow a council to be a valid
  tribunal for the trial of it. The course which he would have followed if
  the second alternative had been accepted, may be conjectured from the
  measures which, as I shall presently show, he was at this very moment
  secretly pursuing. Henry, however, had happily resolved that he would be
  trifled with no further; he felt instinctively that only action would cut
  the net in which he was entangled; and he would not hesitate any longer
  to take a step which, in one way or another, must bring the weary
  question to a close. If the pope meant well, he would welcome a
  resolution which made further procrastination impossible; if he did not
  mean well, he could not be permitted to dally further with the interests
  of the English nation. Within a few days, therefore, of Bonner's return
  from Bologna, he took the final step from which there was no retreat, and
  "somewhere about St. Paul's day,"<a name="NtA_405"></a><a
  href="#Nt_405"><sup>405</sup></a> Anne Boleyn received the prize for
  which she had thirsted seven long years, in the hand of the King of
  England. The ceremony was private. No authentic details are known either
  of the scene of it or the circumstances under which it took place; but it
  is said to have been performed by the able Rowland Lee, Bishop of
  Lichfield, summoned up for the purpose from the Welsh Marches, of which
  he was warden. It was done, however&mdash;in one way or other finally
  done&mdash;the cast was thrown, and a match was laid to the train which
  now at length could explode the spell of intrigue, and set Henry and
  England free.</p>

  <p>We have arrived at a point from which the issue of the labyrinth is
  clearly visible. The course of it has been very dreary; and brought in
  contact as we have been with so much which is painful, so much which is
  discreditable to all parties concerned, we may perhaps have lost our
  sense of the broad bearings of the question in indiscriminate disgust. It
  will be well, therefore, to pause for a moment to recapitulate those
  features of the story which are the main indications of its character,
  and may serve to guide our judgment in the censure which we shall
  pass.</p>

  <p>It may be admitted, or it ought to be admitted, that if Henry VIII.
  had been contented to rest his demand for a divorce merely on the
  interests of the kingdom, if he had forborne, while his <!-- Page 254
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span> request
  was pending, to affront the princess who had for many years been his
  companion and his queen; if he had shown her that respect which her high
  character gave her a right to demand, and which her situation as a
  stranger ought to have made it impossible to him to refuse; his conduct
  would have been liable to no imputation, and our sympathies would without
  reserve have been on his side. He could not have been expected to love a
  person to whom he had been married as a boy for political convenience,
  merely because she was his wife; especially when she was many years his
  senior in age, disagreeable in her person, and by the consciousness of it
  embittered in her temper. His kingdom demanded the security of a stable
  succession; his conscience, it may not be doubted, was seriously agitated
  by the loss of his children; and looking upon it as the sentence of
  Heaven upon a connection, the legality of which had from the first been
  violently disputed, he believed that he had been living in incest, and
  that his misfortunes were the consequence of it. Under these
  circumstances he had a full right to apply for a divorce.<a
  name="NtA_406"></a><a href="#Nt_406"><sup>406</sup></a></p>

  <p>The causa urgentissima of the canon law for which, by the pope's own
  showing, the dispensing powers had been granted to him, had arisen in an
  extreme form; and when the vital interests of England were sacrificed to
  the will of a foreign prince, sufficient reason had arisen for the nation
  to decline submission to so emphatic injustice, and to seek within itself
  its own remedies for its own necessities. These considerations must be
  allowed all their weight; and except for them, it is not to be supposed
  that Henry would have permitted private distaste or inclination to induce
  him to create a scandal in Europe. In his conduct, however, as in that of
  most men, good was chequered with evil, and sincerity with
  self-deception. Personal feeling can be traced from the first, holding a
  subsidiary, indeed, but still an influential place, among his motives;
  and exactly so far as he was influenced by it, his course was wrong, as
  the consequence miserably proved. The position which, in his wife's
  presence, he assigned to another woman, however he may have persuaded
  <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>[pg
  255]</span> himself that Catherine had no claim to be considered his
  wife, admits neither of excuse nor of palliation; and he ought never to
  have shared his throne with a person who consented to occupy that
  position. He was blind to the coarseness of Anne Boleyn, because, in
  spite of his chivalry, his genius, his accomplishments, in his relations
  with women he was without delicacy himself. He directed, or attempted to
  direct, his conduct by the broad rules of what he thought to be just; and
  in the wide margin of uncertain ground where rules of action cannot be
  prescribed, and where men must guide themselves by consideration for the
  feelings of others, he&mdash;so far as women were concerned&mdash;was
  altogether or almost a stranger. Such consideration is a virtue which can
  be learned only in the society of equals, where necessity obliges men to
  practise it. Henry had been a king from his boyhood; he had been
  surrounded by courtiers who had anticipated all his desires; and exposed
  as he was to an ordeal from which no human being could have escaped
  uninjured, we have more cause, after all, to admire him for those
  excellences which he conquered for himself, than to blame the defects
  which he retained.</p>

  <p>But if in his private relations the king was hasty and careless,
  towards the pope to whom we must now return, he exhausted all resources
  of forbearance: and although, when separation from Rome was at length
  forced upon him, he then permitted no half measures, and swept into his
  new career with the strength of irresistible will, it was not till he had
  shown resolution no less great in the endurance of indignity; and of the
  three great powers in Europe, the prince who was compelled to break the
  unity of the Catholic church, was evidently the only one who was capable
  of real sacrifices to preserve it unbroken. Clement comprehended his
  reluctance, but presumed too far upon it; and if there was sin in the
  "great schism" of the Reformation, the guilt must rest where it is due.
  We have now to show the reverse side of the transactions at Bologna, and
  explain what a person wearing the title of his Holiness, in virtue of his
  supposed sanctity, had been secretly doing.</p>

  <p>In January, 1532, some little time before his conversation with Sir
  Gregory Cassalis on the subject of the two wives, the pope had composed a
  pastoral letter to Henry, which had never been issued. From its contents
  it would seem to have been written on the receipt of an indignant
  remonstrance of Queen Catherine, in which she had complained of her
  desertion by her husband, and of the public position which had been given
  to her <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>[pg
  256]</span> rival. She had supposed (and it was the natural mistake of an
  embittered and injured woman) that Anne Boleyn had been placed in
  possession of the rights of an actual, and not only of an intended wife;
  and the pope, accepting her account of the situation, had written to
  implore the king to abstain, so long as the cause remained undetermined,
  from creating so great a scandal in Christendom, and to restore his late
  queen to her place at his side. This letter, as it was originally
  written, was one of Clement's happiest compositions.<a
  name="NtA_407"></a><a href="#Nt_407"><sup>407</sup></a> He abstained in
  it from using any expression which could be construed into a threat: he
  appealed to Henry's honourable character, which no blot had hitherto
  stained; and dwelling upon the general confusion of the Christian world,
  he urged with temperate earnestness the ill effects which would be
  produced by so open a defiance of the injunctions of the Holy See in a
  person of so high a position. So far all was well. Henry had deserved
  that such a letter should be written to him; and the pope was more than
  justified in writing it. The letter, however, if it was sent, produced no
  effect, and on the 15th of November, three days before Clement's
  departure to Bologna, where he pretended (we must not forget) that he
  considered Henry substantially right; he added a postscript, in a tone
  not contrasting only with his words to the ambassadors, but with the
  language of the brief itself.</p>

  <p>Again urging Henry's delinquencies, his separation from his wife, and
  the scandal of his connection with another person, he commanded him,
  under penalty of excommunication, within one month of the receipt of
  those injunctions, to restore the queen to her place, and to abstain
  thenceforward from all intercourse with Anne Boleyn pending the issue of
  the trial. "Otherwise," the pope continued, "when the said term shall
  have elapsed, we pronounce thee, Henry King of England, and the said
  Anne, to be <i>ipso facto</i> excommunicate, and command all men to shun
  and avoid your presence; and although our mind shrinks from allowing such
  a thought of your Serenity, although by ourselves and by our auditory of
  the Rota an inhibition has been already issued against you; although the
  act of which you are suspected be in itself forbidden by all laws human
  and divine, yet the reports which are brought to us do so move us, that
  once more we do inhibit you from dissolving your marriage with the
  aforesaid Catherine, or from continuing process, in your own courts, of
  divorce from her. And we do also hereby warn you, <!-- Page 257 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span> that you presume
  not to contract any new marriage with the said or with any other woman;
  we declare such marriage, if you still attempt it, to be vain and of none
  effect, and so to be regarded by all persons in obedience to the
  Apostolic see."<a name="NtA_408"></a><a
  href="#Nt_408"><sup>408</sup></a></p>

  <p>An inhibitory mandate, was a natural consequence of the conference of
  Calais, provided that the pope intended to proceed openly and uprightly;
  and if it had been sent upon the spot, Henry could have complained of
  nothing worse than of an honourable opposition to his wishes. But the
  mystery was not yet exhausted. The postscript was not issued, it was not
  spoken of; it was carried secretly to Bologna, and it bears at its foot a
  further date of the 23rd of December, the very time, that is to say, at
  which the pope was representing himself to Bennet as occupied only in
  devising the best means of satisfying Henry, and to Sir Gregory Cassalis,
  as so convinced of the justice of the English demands, that he had
  ventured in defence of them to the edge of rupture with the emperor.</p>

  <p>It might be urged that he was sincere both in his brief and in his
  conversation; that he believed that a verdict ought to be given, and
  would at last be given, against the original marriage, and that therefore
  he was the more anxious to prevent unnecessary scandal. Yet a menace of
  excommunication couched in so haughty a tone, could have been honestly
  reconciled with his other conduct, only by his following a course with
  respect to it which he did not follow&mdash;by informing the ambassadors
  openly of what he had done, and transmitting his letter through their
  hands to Henry himself. This he might have done; and though the issue of
  such a document at such a time would have been open to question, it might
  nevertheless have been defended. His Holiness, however, did nothing of
  the kind. No hint was let fall of the existence of any minatory brief; he
  sustained his pretence of good will, till there was no longer any
  occasion for him to counterfeit; and two months later it suddenly
  appeared on the doors of the churches in Flanders.</p>

  <p>Henry at first believed it to be forgery, One forged brief had already
  been produced by the imperialists in the course of their transactions,
  and he imagined that this was another; even his past experience of
  Clement had not prepared him for this last venture of effrontery; he
  wrote to Bennet, enclosing a copy, and requiring him to ascertain if it
  were really genuine.<a name="NtA_409"></a><a
  href="#Nt_409"><sup>409</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>[pg 258]</span>

  <p>The pope could not deny his hand, though the exposure, and the strange
  irregular character of the brief itself troubled him, and Bonner, who was
  again at the papal court, said that "he was in manner ashamed, and in
  great perplexity what he might do therein."<a name="NtA_410"></a><a
  href="#Nt_410"><sup>410</sup></a></p>

  <p>His conduct will be variously interpreted, and to attempt to analyse
  the motives of a double-minded man is always a hazardous experiment; but
  a comparison of date, the character of Clement himself, the circumstances
  in which he was placed, and the retrospective evidence from after events,
  points almost necessarily to but one interpretation. It is scarcely
  disputable that, frightened at the reception of Anne Boleyn in France,
  the pope found it necessary to pretend for a time an altered disposition
  towards Henry; and that the emperor, unable to feel wholly confident that
  a person who was false to others was true to himself, had exacted the
  brief from him as a guarantee for his good faith; Charles, on his side,
  reserving the publication until Francis had been gained over, and until
  Clement was screened against the danger which he so justly feared, from
  the consequences of the interview at Calais.</p>

  <p>There was duplicity of a kind; this cannot be denied; and if not
  designed to effect this object, this object in fact it answered. While
  Clement was talking smoothly to Bennet and Cassalis, secret overtures
  were advanced at Paris for a meeting at Nice between the pope, the
  emperor, and the King of France, from which Henry was to be excluded.<a
  name="NtA_411"></a><a href="#Nt_411"><sup>411</sup></a> The emperor made
  haste with concessions to Francis, which but a few months before would
  have seemed impossible. He withdrew his army out of Lombardy, and left
  Italy free; he consented to the marriage which he had so earnestly
  opposed between Catherine de Medici and the Duke of Orleans, agreeing
  also, it is probable, to the contingency of the Duchy of Milan becoming
  ultimately her dowry. And Francis having coquetted with the proposal for
  <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>[pg
  259]</span> the Nice meeting,<a name="NtA_412"></a><a
  href="#Nt_412"><sup>412</sup></a> not indeed accepting, but not
  absolutely rejecting it, Charles consented also to waive his objections
  to the interview between Francis and the pope, on which he had looked
  hitherto with so much suspicion; provided that the pope would bear in
  mind some mysterious and unknown communication which had passed at
  Bologna.<a name="NtA_413"></a><a href="#Nt_413"><sup>413</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus was Francis won. He cared only, as the pope had seen, for his own
  interests; and from this time he drew away, by imperceptible degrees,
  from his engagements to England. He did not stoop to dishonour or
  treacherous betrayal of confidence, for with all his faults he was, in
  the technical acceptation of that misused term, a gentleman. He declined
  only to maintain the attitude which, if he had continued in it, would
  have compelled the pope to yield; and although he continued honestly to
  urge him to make concessions, he no longer affected to make them the
  price of preserving France in allegiance to the Holy See. Nor need we
  regret that Francis shrank from a resolution which Henry had no right to
  require of him. To have united with France in a common schism at the
  crisis of the Reformation would have only embarrassed the free motions of
  England; and two nations whose interests and whose tendencies were
  essentially opposite, might not submit to be linked together by the
  artificial interests of their princes. The populace of England were
  unconsciously on the rapid road to Protestantism. The populace of <!--
  Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span>
  France were fanatically Catholic. England was to go her way through a
  golden era of Elizabeth to Cromwell, the Puritans, and a Protestant
  republic; a republic to be perpetuated, if not in England herself, yet
  among her great children beyond the sea. France was to go her way through
  Bartholomew massacres and the dragonnades to a polished Louis the
  Magnificent, and thence to the bloody Medea's cauldron of Revolution, out
  of which she was to rise as now we know her. No common road could have
  been found for such destinies as these; and the French prince followed
  the direction of his wiser instincts when he preferred a quiet
  arrangement with the pope, in virtue of which his church should be
  secured by treaty the liberties which she desired, to a doubtful struggle
  for a freedom which his people neither wished nor approved. The interests
  of the nation were in fact his own. He could ill afford to forsake a
  religion which allowed him so pleasantly to compound for his amatory
  indulgences by the estrapade<a name="NtA_414"></a><a
  href="#Nt_414"><sup>414</sup></a> and a zeal for orthodoxy.</p>

  <p>It became evident to Henry early in the spring that he was left
  substantially alone. His marriage had been kept secret with the intention
  that it should be divulged by the King of France to the pope when he met
  him at Marseilles; and as the pope had pretended an anxiety that either
  the King of England should be present in person at that interview, or
  should be represented by an ambassador of adequate rank, a train had been
  equipped for the occasion, the most magnificent which England could
  furnish. Time, meanwhile, passed on; the meeting, which was to have taken
  place first in January, and then in April, was delayed till October, and
  in the interval the papal brief had appeared in Flanders; the queen's
  pregnancy could not admit of concealment; and the evident proof which
  appeared that France was no longer to be depended upon, convinced the
  English government that they had nothing to hope for from abroad, and
  that Henry's best resources were to be found, where in fact they had
  always been, in the strength and affection of his own people.</p>

  <p>From this choking atmosphere, therefore, we now turn back to England
  and the English parliament; and the change is from darkness to light,
  from death to life. Here was no wavering, <!-- Page 261 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span> no uncertainty, no
  smiling faces with false hearts behind them; but the steady purpose of
  resolute men, who slowly, and with ever opening vision, bore the nation
  forward to the fair future which was already dawning.</p>

  <p>Parliament met at the beginning of February, a few days after the
  king's marriage, which, however, still remained a secret. It is, I think,
  no slight evidence of the calmness with which the statesmen of the day
  proceeded with their work, that in a session so momentous, in a session
  in which the decisive blow was to be struck of the most serious
  revolution through which the country as yet had passed, they should have
  first settled themselves calmly down to transact what was then the
  ordinary business of legislation, the struggle with the vital evils of
  society. The first nine statutes which were passed in this session were
  economic acts to protect the public against the frauds of money-making
  tradesmen; to provide that shoes and boots should be made of honest
  leather; that food should be sold at fair prices, that merchants should
  part with their goods at fair profits; to compel, or as far as the
  legislature was able to do it, to compel all classes of persons to be
  true men; to deal honestly with each other, in that high Quixotic sense
  of honesty which requires good subjects at all times and under all
  circumstances to consider the interests of the commonwealth as more
  important than their own. I have already spoken of this economic
  legislation, and I need not dwell now upon details of it; although under
  some aspects it may be thought that more which is truly valuable in
  English history lies in these unobtrusive statutes than in all our noisy
  wars, reformations, and revolutions. The history of this as of all other
  nations (or so much of it as there is occasion for any of us to know), is
  the history of the battles which it has fought and won with evil; not
  with political evil merely, or spiritual evil; but with all
  manifestations whatsoever of the devil's power. And to have beaten back,
  or even to have struggled against and stemmed in ever so small a degree
  those besetting basenesses of human nature, now held so invincible that
  the influences of them are assumed as the fundamental axioms of economic
  science; this appears to me a greater victory than Agincourt, a grander
  triumph of wisdom and faith and courage than even the English
  constitution or the English liturgy. Such a history, however, lies beside
  the purpose which I may here permit myself; and the two acts with which
  the session closed, alone in this place require our attention.</p>

  <p>The first of these is one of the many "Acts of Apparel," <!-- Page 262
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span> which are
  to be found in the early volumes of the statute book. The meaning of
  these laws becomes intelligible when we reflect upon the condition of the
  people. The English were an organised nation of soldiers; they formed an
  army perpetually ready for the field, where the degrees were determined
  by social position; and the dresses prescribed to the various orders of
  society were the graduated uniforms which indicated the rank of the
  wearers. When every man was a soldier, and every gentleman was an
  officer, the same causes existed for marking, by costume, the
  distinctions of authority, which lead to the answering differences in the
  modern regiments.</p>

  <p>The changing conditions of the country at the time of the Reformation,
  the growth of a middle class, with no landed possessions, yet made
  wealthy by trade or other industry, had tended necessarily to introduce
  confusion; and the policy of this reign, which was never more markedly
  operative than during the most critical periods of it, was to
  reinvigorate the discipline of the feudal system; and pending the growth
  of what might better suit the age, pending the great struggle in which
  the nation was engaged, to hold every man at his post. The statute
  specifies its object, and the motives with which it was passed.</p>

  <p>"Whereas," says the preamble, "divers laws, ordinances, and statutes
  have been with great deliberation and advice provided and established for
  the necessary repressing and avoiding the inordinate excess daily more
  and more used in the sumptuous and costly array and apparel accustomably
  worn in this realm, whereof hath ensued, and daily do chance such sundry
  high and notable inconveniences as be to the great and notorious
  detriment of the commonweal, the subversion of politic order in knowledge
  and distinction of people according to their preeminence and degrees, to
  the utter impoverishment and undoing of many light and inexpert persons
  inclined to pride, the mother of all vices: Be it enacted,"<a
  name="NtA_415"></a><a href="#Nt_415"><sup>415</sup></a>&mdash;but I need
  not enter into the particulars of the uniforms worn by the nobles and
  gentlemen of the court of Henry VIII.; the temper, not the detail, is of
  importance; and of the wisdom or unwisdom of such enactments, we who live
  in a changed age should be cautious of forming a hasty opinion. The ends
  which the old legislation proposed to itself, have in latter ages been
  resigned as impracticable. We are therefore no longer adequate judges how
  far those ends may in other times have been attainable, and we can still
  less judge of the means through which the attainment of them was
  sought.</p>

  <p>The second act of which I have to speak is open to no such ambiguity;
  it remains among the few which are and will be of perpetual moment in our
  national history. The conduct of the pope had forced upon the parliament
  the reconsideration of the character of his supremacy; and when the
  question had once been asked, in the existing state of feeling but one
  answer to it was possible.</p>

  <p>The authority of the church over the state, the supreme kingship of
  Christ, and consequently of him who was held to be Christ's vicar, above
  all worldly sovereignties, was an established reality of mediæval Europe.
  The princes had with difficulty preserved their jurisdiction in matters
  purely secular; while in matters spiritual, and in that vast section of
  human affairs in which the spiritual and the secular glide one into the
  other, they had been compelled&mdash;all such of them as lay within the
  pale of the Latin communion&mdash;to acknowledge a power superior to
  their own. To the popes was the ultimate appeal in all causes of which
  the spiritual courts had cognisance. Their jurisdiction had been extended
  by an unwavering pursuit of a single policy, and their constancy in the
  twelfth century was rewarded by absolute victory. In England, however,
  the field was no sooner won than it was again disputed, and the civil
  government gave way at last only when the danger seemed to have ceased.
  So long as the papacy was feared, so long as the successors of St. Peter
  held a sword which could inflict sensible wounds, and enforce obedience
  by penalties, the English kings had resisted both the theory and the
  application. While the pope was dangerous he was dreaded and opposed.
  When age had withered his arm, and the feeble lightnings flickered in
  harmless insignificance, they consented to withdraw their watchfulness,
  and his supremacy was silently allowed as an innocent superstition. It
  existed as some other institutions exist at the present day, with a
  merely nominal authority; with a tacit understanding, that the power
  which it was permitted to retain should be exerted only in conformity
  with the national will.</p>

  <p>Under these conditions the Tudor princes became loyal subjects to the
  Holy See, and so they would have willingly remained, had not Clement, in
  an evil hour for himself, forgotten the terms of the compact. He laid
  upon a legal fiction a strain which his predecessors, in their palmiest
  days, would have feared to attempt; and the nation, after grave
  remonstrance, which was only received with insults, exorcised the chimæra
  <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>[pg
  264]</span> with a few resolute words for ever. The parliament, in
  asserting the freedom of England, carefully chose their language. They
  did not pass a new law, but they passed an act declaratory merely of the
  law which already existed, and which they were vindicating against
  illegal encroachment. "Whereas," says the Statute of Appeals, "by divers
  sundry old authentic histories and chronicles, it is manifestly declared
  and expressed that this realm of England is an empire, and so hath been
  accepted in the world; governed by one supreme head and king, having the
  dignity and royal estate of the imperial crown of the same; unto whom a
  body politic compact of all sorts and degrees of people, divided in terms
  by names of spiritualty and temporalty, be bound and ought to bear, next
  to God, a natural and humble obedience: he being also institute and
  furnished by the goodness and sufferance of Almighty God with plenary,
  whole, and entire power, pre-eminence and authority, prerogative and
  jurisdiction, to render and yield justice and final determination to all
  manner of folk resident or subject within this his realm, without
  restraint or provocation to any foreign prince or potentate of the world:
  the body spiritual whereof having power when any cause of the law divine
  happened to come in question, or of spiritual learning, [such cause
  being] declared, interpret, and shewed by that part of the body politic
  called the spiritualty, now usually called the English church; (which
  also hath been reported and also found of that sort, that both for
  knowledge, integrity, and sufficiency of numbers, it hath been always
  thought to be, and is also at this hour sufficient and meet of itself,
  without the interfering of any exterior person or persons, to declare and
  determine all such doubts, and to administer all such offices and duties
  as to the administration of their rooms spiritual doth appertain): and
  the laws temporal, for trial of property of lands and goods, and for the
  conservation of the people of this realm in unity and peace, having been
  and yet being administered, adjudged, and executed by sundry judges and
  administers of the said body politic called the temporalty: and seeing
  that both these authorities and jurisdictions do conjoin together for the
  due administration of justice, the one to help the other: and whereas the
  king's most noble progenitors, and the nobility and commons of this said
  realm at divers and sundry parliaments, as well in the time of King
  Edward I., Edward III., Richard II., Henry IV., and other noble kings of
  this realm, made sundry ordinances, laws, and provisions for the
  conservation of the prerogatives, liberties, <!-- Page 265 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>[pg 265]</span> and pre-eminences
  of the imperial crown of this realm, and of the jurisdiction spiritual
  and temporal of the same, to keep it from the annoyance as well of the
  see of Rome as from the authority of other foreign potentates attempting
  the diminution or violation thereof, as often as from time to time any
  such annoyance or attempt might be known or espied: and notwithstanding
  the said good statutes and ordinances, and since the making thereof,
  divers inconveniences and dangers not provided for plainly by the said
  statutes, have risen and sprung by reason of appeals sued out of this
  realm to the see of Rome, in causes testamentary, causes of matrimony and
  divorce, right of tithes, oblations, and obventions, not only to the
  great inquietation, vexation, trouble, costs, and charges of the King's
  Highness, and many of his subjects and residents in this his realm; but
  also to the delay and let of the speedy determination of the said causes,
  for so much as parties appealing to the said court of Rome most commonly
  do the same for the delay of justice; and forasmuch as the great distance
  of way is so far out of this realm, so that the necessary proofs, nor the
  true knowledge of the causes, can neither there be so well known, nor the
  witnesses so well examined there as within this realm, so that the
  parties grieved by means of the said appeals be most times without
  remedy; in consideration hereof, all testamentary and matrimonial causes,
  and all suits for tithes, oblations, and obventions shall henceforth be
  adjudged in the spiritual and temporal courts within the realm, without
  regard to any process of foreign jurisdiction, or any inhibition,
  excommunication, or interdict. Persons procuring processes, inhibitions,
  appeals, or citations from the court of Rome, as well as their fautors,
  comforters, counsellors, aiders and abettors, all and every of them shall
  incur the penalties of premunire; and in all such cases as have hitherto
  admitted of appeal to Rome, the appeals shall be from the Archdeacon's
  court to the Bishop's court, from the Bishop's court to that of the
  Archbishop, and no further."<a name="NtA_416"></a><a
  href="#Nt_416"><sup>416</sup></a></p>

  <p>The act was carried through Parliament in February, but again, as with
  the Annates Bill, the king delayed his sanction till the post could reach
  and return from the Vatican. The Bishop of Bayonne wrote that there was
  hope that Clement might yet give way, and entreated that the king would
  send an "excusator," a person formally empowered to protest for him that
  he could not by the laws of England plead at a foreign <!-- Page 266
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>[pg 266]</span> tribunal;
  and that with this imperfect recognition of his authority the pope would
  be satisfied.</p>

  <p>Chastillon, the French ambassador, had an interview with the king, to
  communicate the bishop's message.</p>

  <p>"The morning after," Chastillon wrote, "his Majesty sent for me and
  desired me to repeat my words before the council. I obeyed; but the
  majority declared, that there was nothing in them to act upon, and that
  the king must not put himself in subjection. His Majesty himself, too, I
  found less warm than in his preceding conversation. I begged the council
  to be patient. I said everything that I could think of likely to weigh
  with the king, I promised him a sentence from our Holy Father declaring
  his first marriage null, his present marriage good. I urged him on all
  grounds, public and private, to avoid a rupture with the Holy See. Such a
  sentence, I said, would be the best security for the queen, and the
  safest guarantee for the unopposed succession of her offspring. If the
  marriage was confirmed by the Holy Father's authority, the queen's
  enemies would lose the only ground where they could make a stand. The
  peace of the realm was now menaced. The emperor talked loudly and made
  large preparations. Let the king be allied with France, and through
  France with the Holy See, and the emperor could do him no harm. Thus I
  said my proposals were for the benefit of the realm of his Majesty, and
  of the children who might be born to him. The king would act more
  prudently both for his own interest, and for the interest of his
  children, in securing himself, than in running a risk of creating
  universal confusion; and, besides, he owed something to the king his
  brother, who had worked so long and so hard for him.</p>

  <p>"After some further conversation, his Majesty took me aside into a
  garden, where he told me that for himself he agreed in what I had said;
  but he begged me to keep his confidence secret. He fears, I think, to
  appear to condescend too easily.</p>

  <p>"He will not, however, publish the acts of parliament till he sees
  what is done at Rome. The vast sums of money which used to be sent out of
  the country will go no longer; but in other respects he will be glad to
  return to good terms. He will send the excusator when he hears again from
  M. de Paris; and for myself, I think, that although the whole country is
  in a blaze against the pope, yet with the good will and assistance of the
  king, the Holy Father will be reinstated in the greater part of his
  prerogatives."</p>

  <p>But the hope that the pope would yield proved again delusive. <!--
  Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>[pg 267]</span>
  Henry wrote to him himself in the spirit of his conversation with
  Chastillon. His letter was presented by Cardinal Tournon, and Clement
  said all that could be said in acknowledgment without making the one
  vital concession. But whenever it was put before him that the cause must
  be heard and decided in England and in no other place, he talked in the
  old language of uncertainty and impossibilities;<a name="NtA_417"></a><a
  href="#Nt_417"><sup>417</sup></a> and Henry learning at the same time
  that a correspondence was going forward between Clement and Francis, with
  the secrets of which he was not made acquainted, went forward upon his
  own way. April brought with it the certainty that the expected
  concessions were delusive. Anne Boleyn's pregnancy made further delay
  impossible. D'Inteville, who had succeeded Chastillon as French
  ambassador, once more attempted to interfere, but in vain. Henry told him
  he could not help himself, the pope forced him to the course which he was
  pursuing, by the answer which he had been pleased to issue; and he could
  only encounter enmity with its own weapons. "The archbishop," d'Inteville
  wrote to Francis, "will try the question, and will give judgment. I
  entreated the king to wait till the conference at Nice, but he would not
  consent. I prayed him to keep the sentence secret till the pope had seen
  your Majesty; he replied it was impossible."<a name="NtA_418"></a><a
  href="#Nt_418"><sup>418</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus the statute became law which transferred to the English courts of
  law the power so long claimed and exercised by the Roman see. There are
  two aspects under which it may be regarded, as there were two objects for
  which it was passed. Considered as a national act, few persons will now
  deny that it was as just in itself as it was politically desirable. If
  the pope had no jurisdiction over English subjects, it was well that he
  should be known to have none; if he had, it was equally well that such
  jurisdiction should cease. The question was not of communion between the
  English and Roman churches, which might or might not continue, but which
  this act would not affect. The pope might still retain his rights of
  episcopal precedency, whatever those might be, with all the privileges
  attached to it. The parliament merely declared that he possessed no right
  of interference in domestic disputes affecting persons and property.</p>

  <p>But the act had a special as well as a national bearing, and here it
  is less easy to arrive at a just conclusion. It destroyed <!-- Page 268
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>[pg 268]</span> the
  validity of Queen Catherine's appeal; it placed a legal power in the
  hands of the English judges to proceed to pass sentence upon the divorce;
  and it is open to the censure which we ever feel entitled to pass upon a
  measure enacted to meet the particular position of a particular person.
  When embarrassments have arisen from unforeseen causes, we have a right
  to legislate to prevent a repetition of those embarrassments. Our
  instincts tell us that no legislation should be retrospective, and should
  affect only positions which have been entered into with a full knowledge
  at the time of the condition of the laws.</p>

  <p>The statute endeavours to avoid the difficulty by its declaratory
  form; but again this is unsatisfactory; for that the pope possessed some
  authority was substantially acknowledged in every application which was
  made to him; and when Catherine had married under a papal dispensation,
  it was a strange thing to turn upon her, and to say, not only that the
  dispensation in the particular instance had been unlawfully granted, but
  that the pope had no jurisdiction in the matter by the laws of the land
  which she had entered.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, throughout the entire negotiations King Henry and
  his ministers had insisted jealously on the English privileges. They had
  declared from the first that they might, if they so pleased, fall back
  upon their own laws. In desiring that the cause might be heard by a papal
  legate in England, they had represented themselves rather as
  condescending to a form than acknowledging a right; and they had, in
  fact, in allowing the opening of Campeggio's court, fallen, all of them,
  even Henry himself, under the penalties of the statutes of provisors. The
  validity of Catherine's appeal they had always consistently denied. If
  the papal jurisdiction was to be admitted at all, it could only be
  through a minister sitting as judge within the realm of England; and the
  maxim, "Ne Angli extra Angliam litigare cogantur," was insisted upon as
  the absolute privilege of every English subject.</p>

  <p>Yet, if we allow full weight to these considerations, a feeling of
  painful uncertainty continues to cling to us; and in ordinary cases to be
  uncertain on such a point is to be in reality certain. The state of the
  law could not have been clear, or the statute of appeals would not have
  been required; and explain it as we may, it was in fact passed for a
  special cause against a special person; and that person a woman.</p>

  <p>How far the parliament was justified by the extremity of the case is a
  further question, which it is equally difficult to answer. <!-- Page 269
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269"></a>[pg 269]</span> The
  alternative, as I have repeatedly said, was an all but inevitable civil
  war, on the death of the king; and practically, when statesmen are
  entrusted with the fortunes of an empire, the responsibility is too heavy
  to allow them to consider other interests. Salus populi suprema lex, ever
  has been and ever will be the substantial canon of policy with public
  men, and morality is bound to hesitate before it censures them. There are
  some acts of injustice which no national interest can excuse, however
  great in itself that interest may be, or however certain to be attained
  by the means proposed. Yet government, in its easiest tax, trenches to a
  certain extent on natural right and natural freedom; and trenches further
  and further in proportion to the emergency with which it has to deal. How
  far it may go in this direction, or whether Henry VIII. and his
  parliament went too far, is a difficult problem; their best justification
  is an exceptive clause introduced into the act, which was intended
  obviously to give Queen Catherine the utmost advantage which was
  consistent with the liberties of the realm. "In case," says the
  concluding paragraph, "of any cause, or matter, or contention now
  depending for the causes before rehearsed, or that hereafter shall come
  into contention for any of the same causes in any of the foresaid courts,
  which hath, doth, shall, or may touch the king, his heirs or successors,
  kings of this realm; in all or every such case or cases the party grieved
  as aforesaid shall or may appeal from any of the said courts of this
  realm, to the spiritual prelates and other abbots and priors of the Upper
  House, assembled and convocate by the king's writ in convocation."<a
  name="NtA_419"></a><a href="#Nt_419"><sup>419</sup></a> If Catherine's
  cause was as just as Catholics and English high churchmen are agreed to
  consider it, the English church might have saved her. If Catherine
  herself had thought first or chiefly of justice, she would not perhaps
  have accepted the arbitration of the English convocation; but long years
  before she would have been in a cloister.</p>

  <p>Thus it is that while we regret, we are unable to blame; and we cannot
  wish undone an act, to have shrunk from which might have spared a single
  heart, but <i>might</i> have wrecked the English nation. We increase our
  pity for Catherine because she was a princess. We measure the magnitude
  of the evils which human beings endure by their position in the scale of
  society; and misfortunes which private persons would be expected to bear
  without excessive complaining, furnish matter for the lamentation of ages
  when they touch the sacred head which has been circled <!-- Page 270
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>[pg 270]</span> with a
  diadem. Let it be so. Let us compensate the queen's sorrows with
  unstinted sympathy; but let us not trifle with history, by confusing a
  political necessity with a moral crime.</p>

  <p>The English parliament, then, had taken up the gauntlet which the pope
  had flung to it with trembling fingers: and there remained nothing but
  for the Archbishop of Canterbury to make use of the power of which by law
  he was now possessed. And the time was pressing, for the new queen was
  enciente, and further concealment was not to be thought of. The delay of
  the interview between the pope and Francis, and the change in the
  demeanour of the latter, which had become palpably evident, discharged
  Henry of all promises by which he might have bound himself; and to
  hesitate before the menaces of the pope's brief would have been
  fatal.</p>

  <p>The act of appeals being passed, convocation was the authority to
  which the power of determining unsettled points of spiritual law seemed
  to have lapsed. In the month of April, therefore, Cranmer, now Archbishop
  of Canterbury,<a name="NtA_420"></a><a href="#Nt_420"><sup>420</sup></a>
  submitted to it the two questions, on the resolution of which the
  sentence which he was to pass was dependent.</p>

  <p>The first had been already answered separately by the bench of bishops
  and by the universities, and had been agitated from end to end of
  Europe&mdash;was it lawful to marry the widow of a brother dying without
  issue, but having consummated his marriage; and was the Levitical
  prohibition of such a marriage grounded on a divine law, with which the
  pope could not dispense, or on a canon law of which a dispensation was
  permissible?<a name="NtA_421"></a><a
  href="#Nt_421"><sup>421</sup></a></p>

  <p>The pope had declared himself unable to answer; but he had allowed
  that the general opinion was against the power of dispensing,<a
  name="NtA_422"></a><a href="#Nt_422"><sup>422</sup></a> and there could
  be little doubt, therefore, of the reply of the English convocation, or
  at least of the upper house. <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>[pg 271]</span> Fisher attempted an opposition; but
  wholly without effect. The, question was one in which the interests of
  the higher clergy were not concerned, and they were therefore left to the
  dominion of their ordinary understandings. Out of two hundred and
  sixty-three votes, nineteen only were in the pope's favour.<a
  name="NtA_423"></a><a href="#Nt_423"><sup>423</sup></a></p>

  <p>The lower house was less unanimous, as might have been expected, and
  as had been experienced before; the opposition spirit of the English
  clergy being usually then, as much as now, in the ratio of their poverty.
  But there too the nature of the case compelled an overwhelming
  majority.<a name="NtA_424"></a><a href="#Nt_424"><sup>424</sup></a> It
  was decided by both houses that Pope Julius, in granting a licence for
  the marriage of Henry and Catherine, had exceeded his authority, and that
  this marriage was therefore, <i>ab initio</i>, void.</p>

  <p>The other question to be decided was one of fact; whether the marriage
  of Catherine with Prince Arthur had or had not been consummated, a matter
  which the Catholic divines conceived to be of paramount importance, but
  which to few persons at the present day will seem of any importance
  whosoever. We cannot even read the evidence which was produced without a
  sensation of disgust, although in those broader and less conscious ages
  the indelicacy was less obviously perceptible. And we may console
  ourselves with the hope that the discussion was not so wounding as might
  have been expected to the feelings of Queen Catherine, since at all
  official interviews, with all classes of persons, at all times and in all
  places, she appeared herself to court the subject.<a
  name="NtA_425"></a><a href="#Nt_425"><sup>425</sup></a> There is no
  occasion in this place to follow her example. It is enough that
  Ferdinand, at the time of her first marriage, satisfied himself, after
  curious inquiry, that he might hope for a grandchild; and that the fact
  of the consummation was asserted in the treaty between England and Spain,
  which preceded the marriage with Henry, and in this supposed brief of
  Pope Julius which permitted it.<a name="NtA_426"></a><a
  href="#Nt_426"><sup>426</sup></a> We cannot in consequence be surprised
  that the convocation accepted the conclusion which was sanctioned by so
  high authority, and we rather wonder at the persistency of Catherine's
  denials. With respect to this vote, therefore, we <!-- Page 272 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>[pg 272]</span> need notice nothing
  except that Dr. Clerk, Bishop of Bath and Wells<a name="NtA_427"></a><a
  href="#Nt_427"><sup>427</sup></a> was one of an exceedingly small
  minority, who were inclined to believe that the denial might be true, and
  this bishop was one of the four who were associated with Cranmer when he
  sate at Dunstable for the trial of the cause.</p>

  <p>The ground being thus opened, and all preparations being completed,
  the archbishop composed a formal letter to the king, in which he dwelt
  upon the uncertain prospects of the succession, and the danger of leaving
  a question which closely affected it so long unsettled. He expatiated at
  length on the general anxiety which was felt throughout the realm, and
  requested permission to employ the powers attached to his office to bring
  it to some conclusion. The recent alterations had rendered the archbishop
  something doubtful of the nature of his position; he was diffident and
  unwilling to offend; and not clearly knowing in the exercise of the new
  authority which had been granted to him, whether the extension of his
  power was accompanied with a parallel extension of liberty in making use
  of it, he wrote two copies of this letter, with slight alterations of
  language, that the king might select between them the one which he would
  officially recognise. Both these copies are extant; both were written the
  same day from the same place; both were folded, sealed, and sent. It
  seems, therefore, that neither was Cranmer furnished beforehand with a
  draught of what he was to write; nor was his first letter sent back to
  him corrected. He must have acted by his own judgment; and a comparison
  of the two letters is singular and instructive. In the first he spoke of
  his office and duty in language, chastened indeed and modest, but still
  language of independence; and while he declared his unwillingness to
  "enterprise any part of that office" without his Grace's favour obtained,
  and pleasure therein first known, he implied nevertheless that his
  request was rather of courtesy than of obligation, and had arisen rather
  from a sense of moral propriety than because he might not legally enter
  on the exercise of his duty without the permission of the crown.<a
  name="NtA_428"></a><a href="#Nt_428"><sup>428</sup></a></p>

  <p>The moderate gleam of freedom vanishes in the other copy under a few
  pithy changes, as if Cranmer instinctively felt the revolution which had
  taken place in the relations of church and state. Where in the first
  letter he asked for his Grace's favour, in the second he asked for his
  Grace's favour <i>and licence</i>&mdash;where <!-- Page 273 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span> in the first he
  requested to know his Grace's pleasure as to his proceeding, in the
  second he desired his Most Excellent Majesty to <i>license</i> him to
  proceed. The burden of both letters was the same, but the introduction of
  the little word license changed all. It implied a hesitating belief that
  the spiritual judges might perhaps thenceforward be on a footing with the
  temporal judges and the magistrates; that under the new constitution they
  were to understand that they held their offices not directly under God as
  they had hitherto pretended, but under God through the crown.</p>

  <p>The answer of Henry indicated that he had perceived the archbishop's
  uncertainty; and that he was desirous by the emphatic distinctness of his
  own language to spare him a future recurrence of it. He accepted the
  deferential version of the petition; but even Cranmer's anticipation of
  what might be required of him had not reached the reality. In running
  through the preamble, the king flung into the tone of it a character of
  still deeper humility;<a name="NtA_429"></a><a
  href="#Nt_429"><sup>429</sup></a> and he conceded the desired licence in
  the following imperial style. "In consideration of these
  things,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of the grounds urged by the archbishop for the
  petition&mdash;"albeit we being your King and Sovereign, do recognise no
  superior on earth but only God, and not being subject to the laws of any
  earthly creature; yet because ye be under us, by God's calling and ours,
  the most principal minister of our spiritual jurisdiction within this our
  Realm, who we think assuredly is so in the fear of God, and love towards
  the observance of his laws, to the which laws, we as a Christian king
  have always heretofore, and shall ever most obediently submit ourself, we
  will not therefore refuse (our pre-eminence, power, and authority to us
  and to our successors in this behalf nevertheless saved) your humble
  request, offer, and towardness&mdash;that is, to mean to make an end
  according to the will and pleasure of Almighty God in our said great
  cause of matrimony, which hath so long depended undetermined, to our
  great and grievous unquietness and burden of our conscience. Wherefore
  we, inclining to your humble petition, by these our letters sealed with
  our seal, and signed with our sign manual, do license you <!-- Page 274
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span> to proceed
  in the said cause, and the examination and final determination of the
  same; not doubting but that ye will have God and the justice of the said
  cause only before your eyes, and not to regard any earthly or worldly
  affection therein; for assuredly the thing which we most covet in the
  world, is so to proceed in all our acts and doings as may be the most
  acceptable to the pleasure of Almighty God our Creator, to the wealth and
  honour of us, our successors and posterity, and the surety of our Realm,
  and subjects within the same."<a name="NtA_430"></a><a

  <p>The vision of ecclesiastical independence, if Cranmer had indulged in
  it, must have faded utterly before his eyes on receiving this letter. As
  clergy who committed felony were no longer exempted from the penalties of
  their crimes; so henceforward the courts of the clergy were to fell into
  conformity with the secular tribunals. The temporal prerogatives of
  ecclesiastics as a body whose authority over the laity was countervailed
  with no reciprocal obligation, existed no longer. This is what the
  language of the king implied. The difficulty which the persons whom he
  was addressing experienced in realising the change in their position,
  obliged him to be somewhat emphatic in his assertion of it; and it might
  be imagined at first sight, that in insisting on his superiority to the
  officers of the spiritual courts, he claimed a right to dictate their
  sentences. But to venture such a supposition would be to mistake the
  nature of English sovereignty and the spirit of the change. The supreme
  authority in England was the law; and the king no more possessed, or
  claimed a power of controlling the judgment of the bishops or their
  ministers, than he could interfere with the jurisdiction of the judges of
  the bench. All persons in authority, whether in church or state, held
  their offices thenceforth by similar tenure; but the rule of the
  proceedings in each remained alike the law of the land, which Henry had
  no more thought of superseding by his own will than the most
  constitutional of modern princes.</p>

  <p>The closing sentences of his reply to Cranmer are striking, and it is
  difficult to believe that he did not mean what he was saying. From the
  first step in the process to the last, he maintained consistently that
  his only object was to do what was right. He was thoroughly persuaded
  that the course which he was pursuing was sanctioned by justice&mdash;and
  persons who are satisfied that he was entitled to feel such persuasion,
  need not refuse him the merit of sincerity, because (to use the language
  <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>[pg
  275]</span> which Cromwell used at the fatal crisis of his life<a
  name="NtA_431"></a><a href="#Nt_431"><sup>431</sup></a>) "It may be well
  that they who medelle in many matters are not able to answer for them
  all."</p>

  <p>Cranmer, then, being fortified with this permission, and taking with
  him the Bishops of London, Winchester, Lincoln, and Bath and Wells (the
  latter perhaps having been chosen in consequence of his late conduct in
  the convocation, to give show of fairness to the proceeding), went down
  to Dunstable and opened his court there. The queen was at Ampthill, six
  miles distant, having entered on her sad tenancy, it would seem, as soon
  as the place had been evacuated by the gaudy hunting party of the
  preceding summer. The cause being undecided, and her title being
  therefore uncertain, she was called by the safe name of "the Lady
  Catherine," and under this designation she was served with a citation
  from the archbishop to appear before him on Saturday, the 10th of May.
  The bearers of the summons were Sir Francis Bryan (an unfortunate choice,
  for he was cousin of the new queen, and insolent in his manner and
  bearing), Sir Thomas Gage, and Lord Vaux. She received them like herself
  with imperial sorrow. They delivered their message; she announced that
  she refused utterly to acknowledge the competency of the tribunal before
  which she was called; the court was a mockery; the archbishop was a
  shadow.<a name="NtA_432"></a><a href="#Nt_432"><sup>432</sup></a> She
  would neither appear before him in person, nor commission any one to
  appear on her behalf.</p>

  <p>The court had but one course before it&mdash;she was pronounced
  contumacious, and the trial went forward. None of her household were
  tempted even by curiosity to be present. "There came not so much as a
  servant of hers to Dunstable, save such as were brought in as witnesses;"
  some of them having been required to give evidence in the re-examination
  which was thought necessary, as to the nature of the relation of their
  mistress with her first boy husband. As soon as this disgusting question
  had been sufficiently investigated, nothing remained but to pronounce
  judgment. The marriage with the king was declared to have been null and
  void from the beginning, and on the 23rd of May, the archbishop sent to
  London the welcome news that the long matter was at an end.<a
  name="NtA_433"></a><a href="#Nt_433"><sup>433</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span>

  <p>It was over;&mdash;over at last; yet so over, that the conclusion
  could but appear to the losing party a fresh injustice. To those who were
  concerned in bringing it to pass, to the king himself, to the nation, to
  Europe, to every one who heard of it at the time, it must have appeared,
  as it appears now to us who read the story of it, if a necessity, yet a
  most unwelcome and unsatisfying one. That the king remained uneasy is
  evident from the efforts which he continued to make, or which he allowed
  to be made, notwithstanding the brief of the 23rd of December, to gain
  the sanction of the pope. That the nation was uneasy, we should not
  require the evidence of history to tell us. "There was much murmuring in
  England," says Hall, "and it was thought by the unwise that the Bishop of
  Rome would curse all Englishmen; that the emperor and he would destroy
  all the people." And those who had no such fears, and whose judgment in
  the main approved of what had been done, were scandalised <!-- Page 277
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span> at the
  presentation to them at the instant of the publication of the divorce, of
  a new queen, four months advanced in pregnancy. This also was a
  misfortune which had arisen out of the chain of duplicities, a fresh
  accident swelling a complication which was already sufficiently
  entangled. It had been occasioned by steps which at the moment at which
  they were ventured, prudence seemed to justify; but we the more regret
  it, because, in comparison with the interests which were at issue, the
  few months of additional delay were infinitely unimportant.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, we have reason to be thankful that the thing, well or
  ill, was over; seven years of endurance were enough for the English
  nation, and may be supposed to have gained even for Henry a character for
  patience. In some way, too, it is needless to say, the thing must have
  ended. The life of none of us is long enough to allow us to squander so
  large a section of it struggling in the meshes of a law-suit; and
  although there <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span> may be a difference of opinion on the
  wisdom of having first entered upon ground of such a kind, few thinking
  persons can suggest any other method in which either the nation or the
  king could have extricated themselves. Meanwhile, it was resolved that
  such spots and blemishes as hung about the transaction should be
  forgotten in the splendour of the coronation. If there was scandal in the
  condition of the queen, yet under another aspect that condition was
  matter of congratulation to a people so eager for an heir; and Henry may
  have thought that the sight for the first time in public of so beautiful
  a creature, surrounded by the most magnificent pageant which London had
  witnessed since the unknown day on which the first stone of it was laid,
  and bearing in her bosom the long-hoped-for inheritor of the English
  crown, might induce a chivalrous nation to forget what it was the
  interest of no loyal subject to remember longer, and to offer her an
  English welcome to the throne.</p>

  <p>In anticipation of the timely close of the proceedings at Dunstable,
  notice had been given in the city early in May, that preparations should
  be made for the coronation on the first of the following month. Queen
  Anne was at Greenwich, but, according to custom, the few preceding days
  were to be spent at the Tower; and on the 19th of May, she was conducted
  thither in state by the lord mayor and the city companies, with one of
  those splendid exhibitions upon the water which in the days when the
  silver Thames deserved its name, and the sun could shine down upon it out
  of the blue summer sky, were spectacles scarcely rivalled in gorgeousness
  by the world-famous wedding of the Adriatic. The river was crowded with
  boats, the banks and the ships in the pool swarmed with people; and fifty
  great barges formed the procession, all blazing with gold and banners.
  The queen herself was in her own barge, close to that of the lord mayor;
  and in keeping with the fantastic genius of the time, she was preceded up
  the water by "a foyst or wafter full or ordnance, in which was a great
  dragon continually moving and casting wildfire, and round about the foyst
  stood terrible monsters and wild men, casting fire and making hideous
  noise."<a name="NtA_434"></a><a href="#Nt_434"><sup>434</sup></a> So,
  with trumpets blowing, cannon pealing, the Tower guns answering the guns
  of the ships, in a blaze of fireworks and splendour, Anne Boleyn was
  borne along to the great archway of the Tower, where the king was waiting
  on the stairs to receive her.</p>

  <p>And now let us suppose eleven days to have elapsed, the <!-- Page 279
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span> welcome
  news to have arrived at length from Dunstable, and the fair summer
  morning of life dawning in treacherous beauty after the long night of
  expectation. No bridal ceremonial had been possible; the marriage had
  been huddled over like a stolen love-match, and the marriage feast had
  been eaten in vexation and disappointment. These past mortifications were
  to be atoned for by a coronation pageant which the art and the wealth of
  the richest city in Europe should be poured out in the most lavish
  profusion to adorn.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 31st of May, the families of the London citizens
  were stirring early in all houses. From Temple Bar to the Tower, the
  streets were fresh strewed with gravel, the footpaths were railed off
  along the whole distance, and occupied on one side by the guilds, their
  workmen, and apprentices, on the other by the city constables and
  officials in their gaudy uniforms, "with their staves in hand for to
  cause the people to keep good room and order."<a name="NtA_435"></a><a
  href="#Nt_435"><sup>435</sup></a> Cornhill and Gracechurch Street had
  dressed their fronts in scarlet and crimson, in arras and tapestry, and
  the rich carpet-work from Persia and the East. Cheapside, to outshine her
  rivals, was draped even more splendidly in cloth of gold, and tissue, and
  velvet. The sheriffs were pacing up and down on their great Flemish
  horses, hung with liveries, and all the windows were thronged with ladies
  crowding to see the procession pass. At length the Tower guns opened, the
  grim gates rolled back, and under the archway in the bright May sunshine,
  the long column began slowly to defile. Two states only permitted their
  representatives to grace the scene with their presence&mdash;Venice and
  France. It was, perhaps, to make the most of this isolated countenance,
  that the French ambassador's train formed the van of the cavalcade.
  Twelve French knights came riding foremost in surcoats of blue velvet
  with sleeves of yellow silk, their horses trapped in blue, with white
  crosses powdered on their hangings. After them followed a troop of
  English gentlemen, two and two, and then the Knights of the Bath, "in
  gowns of violet, with hoods purfled with miniver like doctors." Next,
  perhaps at a little interval, the abbots passed on, mitred in their
  robes; the barons followed in crimson velvet, the bishops then, and then
  the earls and marquises, the dresses of each order increasing in
  elaborate gorgeousness. All these rode on in pairs. Then came alone
  Audeley, lord-chancellor, and behind him the Venetian ambassador and the
  Archbishop of York; the Archbishop <!-- Page 280 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span> of Canterbury, and
  Du Bellay, Bishop of Bayonne and of Paris, not now with bugle and
  hunting-frock, but solemn with stole and crozier. Next, the lord mayor,
  with the city mace in hand, the Garter in his coat of arms; and then Lord
  William Howard&mdash;Belted Will Howard, of the Scottish Border, Marshal
  of England. The officers of the queen's household succeeded the marshal
  in scarlet and gold, and the van of the procession was closed by the Duke
  of Suffolk, as high constable, with his silver wand. It is no easy matter
  to picture to ourselves the blazing trail of splendour which in such a
  pageant must have drawn along the London streets,&mdash;those streets
  which now we know so black and smoke-grimed, themselves then radiant with
  masses of colour, gold, and crimson, and violet. Yet there it was, and
  there the sun could shine upon it, and tens of thousands of eyes were
  gazing on the scene out of the crowded lattices.</p>

  <p>Glorious as the spectacle was, perhaps however, it passed unheeded.
  Those eyes were watching all for another object, which now drew near. In
  an open space behind the constable there was seen approaching "a white
  chariot," drawn by two palfreys in white damask which swept the ground, a
  golden canopy borne above it making music with silver bells: and in the
  chariot sat the observed of all observers, the beautiful occasion of all
  this glittering homage; fortune's plaything of the hour, the Queen of
  England&mdash;queen at last&mdash;borne along upon the waves of this sea
  of glory, breathing the perfumed incense of greatness which she had
  risked her fair name, her delicacy, her honour, her self-respect, to win;
  and she had won it.</p>

  <p>There she sate, dressed in white tissue robes, her fair hair flowing
  loose over her shoulders, and her temples circled with a light coronet of
  gold and diamonds&mdash;most beautiful&mdash;loveliest&mdash;most
  favoured perhaps, as she seemed at that hour, of all England's daughters.
  Alas! "within the hollow round" of that coronet&mdash;</p>

  <div class="noflo">

      <p>To monarchise, be feared, and kill with looks,</p>
      <p>Infusing her with self and vain conceit,</p>
      <p>As if the flesh which walled about her life</p>

      <p>Bored through her castle walls; and farewell, Queen.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Fatal gift of greatness! so dangerous ever! so more than <!-- Page 281
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span> dangerous
  in those tremendous times when the fountains are broken loose of the
  great deeps of thought; and nations are in the throes of
  revolution;&mdash;when ancient order and law and tradition are splitting
  in the social earthquake; and as the opposing forces wrestle to and fro,
  those unhappy ones who stand out above the crowd become the symbols of
  the struggle, and fall the victims of its alternating fortunes. And what
  if into an unsteady heart and brain, intoxicated with splendour, the
  outward chaos should find its way, converting the poor silly soul into an
  image of the same confusion,&mdash;if conscience should be deposed from
  her high place, and the Pandora box be broken loose of passions and
  sensualities and follies; and at length there be nothing left of all
  which man or woman ought to value, save hope of God's forgiveness.</p>

  <p>Three short years have yet to pass, and again, on a summer morning,
  Queen Anne Boleyn will leave the Tower of London&mdash;not radiant then
  with beauty on a gay errand of coronation, but a poor wandering ghost, on
  a sad tragic errand, from which she will never more return, passing away
  out of an earth where she may stay no longer, into a presence where,
  nevertheless, we know that all is well&mdash;for all of us&mdash;and
  therefore for her.</p>

  <p>But let us not cloud her shortlived sunshine with the shadow of the
  future. She went on in her loveliness, the peeresses following in their
  carriages, with the royal guard in their rear. In Fenchurch Street she
  was met by the children of the city schools; and at the corner of
  Gracechurch Street a masterpiece had been prepared of the pseudo-classic
  art, then so fashionable, by the merchants of the Styll Yard. A Mount
  Parnassus had been constructed, and a Helicon fountain upon it playing
  into a basin with four jets of Rhenish wine. On the top of the mountain
  sat Apollo with Calliope at his feet, and on either side the remaining
  Muses, holding lutes or harps, and singing each of them some "posy" or
  epigram in praise of the queen, which was presented, after it had been
  sung, written in letters of gold.</p>

  <p>From Gracechurch Street, the procession passed to Leadenhall, where
  there was a spectacle in better taste, of the old English Catholic kind,
  quaint perhaps and forced, but truly and even beautifully emblematic.
  There was again a "little mountain," which was hung with red and white
  roses; a gold ring was placed on the summit, on which, as the queen
  appeared, a white falcon was made to "descend as out of the
  sky"&mdash;"and then incontinent came down an angel with great melody,
  and set a <!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span> close crown of gold upon the falcon's
  head; and in the same pageant sat Saint Anne with all her issue beneath
  her; and Mary Cleophas with her four children, of the which children one
  made a goodly oration to the queen, of the fruitfulness of St. Anne,
  trusting that like fruit should come of her."<a name="NtA_436"></a><a
  href="#Nt_436"><sup>436</sup></a></p>

  <p>With such "pretty conceits," at that time the honest tokens of an
  English welcome, the new queen was received by the citizens of London.
  These scenes must be multiplied by the number of the streets, where some
  fresh fancy met her at every turn. To preserve the festivities from
  flagging, every fountain and conduit within the walls ran all day with
  wine; the bells of every steeple were ringing; children lay in wait with
  song, and ladies with posies, in which all the resources of fantastic
  extravagance were exhausted; and thus in an unbroken triumph&mdash;and to
  outward appearance received with the warmest affection&mdash;she passed
  under Temple Bar, down the Strand by Charing Cross to Westminster Hall.
  The king was not with her throughout the day; nor did he intend to be
  with her in any part of the ceremony. She was to reign without a rival,
  the undisputed sovereign of the hour.</p>

  <p>Saturday being passed in showing herself to the people, she retired
  for the night to "the king's manour house at Westminster," where she
  slept. On the following morning, between eight and nine o'clock, she
  returned to the hall, where the lord mayor, the city council, and the
  peers were again assembled, and took her place on the high dais at the
  top of the stairs under the cloth of state; while the bishops, the
  abbots, and the monks of the abbey formed in the area. A railed way had
  been laid with carpets across Palace Yard and the Sanctuary to the abbey
  gates, and when all was ready, preceded by the peers in their robes of
  parliament, the Knights of the Garter in the dress of the order, she
  swept out under her canopy, the bishops and the monks "solemnly singing."
  The train was borne by the old Duchess of Norfolk her aunt, the Bishops
  of London and Winchester on either side "bearing up the lappets of her
  robe." The Earl of Oxford carried the crown on its cushion immediately
  before her. She was dressed in purple velvet furred with ermine, her hair
  escaping loose, as she usually wore it, under a wreath of diamonds.</p>

<!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span>

  <p>On entering the abbey, she was led to the coronation chair Where she
  sat while the train fell into their places, and the preliminaries, of the
  ceremonial were despatched. Then she was conducted up to the high altar,
  and anointed Queen of England, and she received from the hands of
  Cranmer, fresh come in haste from Dunstable, with the last words of his
  sentence upon Catherine scarcely silent upon his lips, the golden
  sceptre, and St. Edward's crown.</p>

  <p>Did any twinge of remorse, any pang of painful recollection, pierce at
  that moment the incense of glory which she was inhaling? Did any vision
  flit across her of a sad mourning figure which once had stood where she
  was standing, now desolate, neglected, sinking into the darkening
  twilight of a life cut short by sorrow? Who can tell? At such a time,
  that figure would have weighed heavily upon a noble mind, and a wise
  mind would have been taught by the thought of it, that although life be
  fleeting as a dream, it is long enough to experience strange vicissitudes
  of fortune. But Anne Boleyn was not noble and was not wise,&mdash;too
  probably she felt nothing but the delicious, all-absorbing,
  all-intoxicating present, and if that plain, suffering face presented
  itself to her memory at all, we may fear that it was rather as a foil to
  her own surpassing loveliness. Two years later, she was able to exult
  over Catherine's death; she is not likely to have thought of her with
  gentler feelings in the first glow and flush of triumph.</p>

  <p>We may now leave these scenes. They concluded in the usual English
  style, with a banquet in the great hall, and with all outward signs of
  enjoyment and pleasure. There must have been but few persons present
  however who did not feel that the sunshine of such a day might not last
  for ever, and that over so dubious a marriage no Englishman could exult
  with more than half a heart. It is foolish to blame lightly actions which
  arise in the midst of circumstances which are and can be but imperfectly
  known; and there may have been political reasons which made so much pomp
  desirable. Anne Boleyn had been the subject of public conversation for
  seven years, and Henry, no doubt, desired to present his jewel to them in
  the rarest and choicest setting. Yet to our eyes, seeing, perhaps, by the
  light of what followed, a more modest introduction would have appeared
  more suited to the doubtful nature of her position.</p>

  <p>At any rate we escape from this scene of splendour very gladly as from
  something unseasonable. It would have been well for Henry VIII. if he had
  lived in a world in which women could <!-- Page 284 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span> have been dispensed
  with; so ill, in all his relations with them, he succeeded. With men he
  could speak the right word, he could do the right thing; with women he
  seemed to be under a fatal necessity of mistake.</p>

  <p>It was now necessary, however, after this public step, to communicate
  in form to the emperor the divorce and the new marriage. The king was
  assured of the rectitude of the motives on which he had himself acted,
  and he knew at the same time that he had challenged the hostility of the
  papal world. Yet he did not desire a quarrel if there were means of
  avoiding it; and more than once he had shown respect for the opposition
  which he had met with from Charles, as dictated by honourable care for
  the interests of his kinswoman. He therefore, in the truest language
  which will be met with in the whole long series of the correspondence,
  composed a despatch for his ambassador at Brussels, and expressed himself
  in a tone of honest sorrow for the injury which he had been compelled to
  commit. Neither the coercion which the emperor had exerted over the pope,
  nor his intrigues with his subjects in Ireland and England, could deprive
  the nephew of Catherine of his right to a courteous explanation; and
  Henry directed Doctor Nicholas Hawkins in making his communication "to
  use only gentle words;" to express a hope that Charles would not think
  only of his own honour, but would remember public justice; and that a
  friendship of long standing, which the interests of the subjects of both
  countries were concerned so strongly in maintaining, might not be broken.
  The instructions are too interesting to pass over with a general
  description. After stating the grounds on which Henry had proceeded, and
  which Charles thoroughly understood, Hawkins was directed to continue
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The King of England is not ignorant what respect is due unto the
  world. How much he hath laboured and travailed therein he hath
  sufficiently declared and showed in his acts and proceedings. If he had
  contemned the order and process of the world, or the friendship and amity
  of your Majesty, he needed not to have sent so often to the pope and to
  you both, nor continued and spent his time in delays. He might have done
  what he has done now, had it so liked him, with as little difficulty as
  now, if without such respect he would have followed his pleasure."</p>

  <p>The minister was then to touch the pope's behaviour and Henry's
  forbearance, and after that to say:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Going forward in that way his Highness saw that he could come to no
  conclusion; and he was therefore compelled to step <!-- Page 285 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span> right forth out of
  the maze, and so to quiet himself at last. And is it not time to have an
  end in seven years? It is not to be asked nor questioned whether the
  matter hath been determined after the common fashion, but whether it hath
  in it common justice, truth, and equity. For observation of the common
  order, his Grace hath done what lay in him. Enforced by necessity he hath
  found the true order which he hath in substance followed with effect, and
  hath done as becometh him. He doubteth not but your Majesty, remembering
  his cause from the beginning hitherto, will of yourself consider and
  think, that among mortal men nothing should be immortal; and suits must
  once have an end, si possis recte, si non quocunque modo. If his Highness
  cannot as he would, then must he do as he may; and he that hath a journey
  to be perfected must, if he cannot go one way, essay another. For his
  matter with the pope, he shall deal with him apart. Your Majesty he
  taketh for his friend, and as to a friend he openeth these matters to
  you, trusting to find your Majesty no less friendly than he hath done
  heretofore."<a name="NtA_437"></a><a
  href="#Nt_437"><sup>437</sup></a></p>

  <p>If courtesy obliged Henry to express a confidence in the stability of
  the relations between himself and Charles, which it was impossible that
  he could have felt, yet in other respects this letter has the most
  pleasant merit of honesty. Hawkins was so much overcome by "the sweetness
  of it," that "he nothing doubted if that the emperor read the same, by
  God's grace he should be utterly persuaded;" and although in this
  expectation he was a little over sanguine, as in calmer moments he would
  have acknowledged, yet plain speech is never without its value; and
  Charles himself after he had tried other expedients, and they had not
  succeeded with him, found it more prudent to acquiesce in what could no
  longer be altered, and to return to cordiality.</p>

  <p>For the present he remained under the impression that by the great
  body of the English the divorce was looked upon with coldness and even
  with displeasure, that the king was supported only by the complacency of
  a few courtiers, and that the nation were prepared to compel him to undo
  the wrong which had been inflicted upon Catherine and the princess. So he
  was assured by the Spanish party in England; so all the disaffected
  assured him, who were perhaps themselves deceived. He had secured
  Ireland, and Scotland also in so far as James's promises could secure
  it;<a name="NtA_438"></a><a href="#Nt_438"><sup>438</sup></a> and he was
  not disposed to surrender for the present so promising a game till he had
  tried his strength and proved his <!-- Page 286 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span> weakness. He
  replied coldly to Hawkins, "That for the King of England's amity he would
  be glad thereof, so the said king would do works according. The matter
  was none of his; but the lady, whose rights had been violated, was his
  aunt and an orphan, and that he must see for her, and for her daughter
  his cousin."<a name="NtA_439"></a><a
  href="#Nt_439"><sup>439</sup></a></p>

  <p>The scarcely ambiguous answer was something softened the following
  day; perhaps only, however, because it was too plain a betrayal of his
  intentions. He communicated at once with Catherine, and Henry speedily
  learnt the nature of the advice which he had given to her. After the
  coronation had passed off so splendidly, when no disturbance had risen,
  no voice had been raised for her or for her daughter, the poor queen's
  spirit for the moment had sunk; she had thought of leaving the country,
  and flying with the Princess Mary to Spain. The emperor sent to urge her
  to remain a little longer, guaranteeing her, if she could command her
  patience, an ample reparation for her injuries. Whatever might appear
  upon the surface, the new queen, he was assured, was little loved by the
  people, and "they were ready to join with any prince who would espouse
  her quarrel."<a name="NtA_440"></a><a href="#Nt_440"><sup>440</sup></a>
  All classes, he said, were agreed in one common feeling of displeasure.
  They were afraid of a change of religion; they were afraid of the wreck
  of their commerce; and the whole country was fast ripening towards
  insurrection. The points on which he relied as the occasion of the
  disaffection betrayed the sources of his information. He was in
  correspondence with the regular clergy through Peto at Antwerp, and
  through his Flemish subjects with merchants of London. Among both these
  classes, as well as among the White Rose nobles, he had powerful
  adherents; and it could not have been forgotten in the courts, either of
  London or Brussels, that within the memory of living men, a small band of
  exiles, equipped by a Duke of Burgundy, had landed at a Yorkshire
  village, and in a month had revolutionised the kingdom.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Charles there was no reason why an attempt which had
  succeeded once might not succeed again under circumstances seemingly of
  far fairer promise. The strength of a party of insurrection is a power
  which official statesmen never justly comprehend. It depends upon moral
  influences, which they are professionally incapable of appreciating. They
  are able complacently to ignore the existence of substantial disaffection
  <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"></a>[pg
  287]</span> though all society may be undermined; they can build their
  hopes, When it suits their convenience, on the idle trifling of
  superficial discontent. In the present instance there was some excuse for
  the mistake. That in England there really existed an active and organised
  opposition, prepared, when opportunity offered, to try the chances of
  rebellion, was no delusion of persons who measured facts by their
  desires; it was an ascertained peril of serious magnitude, which might be
  seriously calculated upon; and if the experiment was tried, reasonable
  men might fairly be divided in opinion on the result to be expected.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the government had been obliged to follow up the
  coronation of the new queen by an act which the situation of the kingdom
  explained and excused; but which, if Catherine had been no more than a
  private person, would have been wanton cruelty. Among the people she
  still bore her royal title; but the name of queen, so long as she was
  permitted to retain it, was an allowed witness against the legality of
  the sentence at Dunstable. There could not be "two queens" in England,<a
  name="NtA_441"></a><a href="#Nt_441"><sup>441</sup></a> and one or other
  must retire from the designation. A proclamation was therefore issued by
  the council, declaring, that in consequence of the final proofs that the
  Lady Catherine had never been lawfully married to the king, she was to
  bear thenceforward the title which she had received after the death of
  her first husband, and be called the Princess Dowager.</p>

  <p>Harsh as this measure was, she had left no alternative to the
  government by which to escape the enforcement of it, by her refusal to
  consent to any form of compromise. If she was queen, Anne Boleyn was not
  queen. If she was queen, the Princess Mary remained the heir to the
  crown, and the expected offspring of Anne would be illegitimate. If the
  question had been merely of names, to have moved it would have been
  unworthy and wicked; but where respect for private feeling was
  incompatible with the steps which a nation felt necessary in order to
  secure itself against civil convulsions, private feeling was compelled
  not unjustly to submit to injury. Mary, though still a girl, had
  inherited both her father's will and her mother's obstinacy. She was in
  correspondence, as we have seen, with the Nun of Kent, and aware at
  least, if she was not further implicated in it, of a conspiracy to place
  her on the throne. Charles was engaged in the same designs; and it will
  not be pretended that Catherine was left without information of what <!--
  Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span>
  was going forward, or that her own conduct was uninfluenced by policy.
  These intrigues it was positively necessary to stifle, and it was
  impossible to leave a pretext of which so powerful a use might be made in
  the hands of a party whose object was not only to secure to the princess
  her right to succeed her father, but to compel him by arms either to
  acknowledge it, or submit to be deposed.<a name="NtA_442"></a><a
  href="#Nt_442"><sup>442</sup></a></p>

  <p>Our sympathies are naturally on the side of the weak and the
  unsuccessful. State considerations lose their force after the lapse of
  centuries, when no interests of our own are any longer in jeopardy; and
  we feel for the great sufferers of history only in their individual
  capacity, without recalling or caring for the political exigencies to
  which they were sacrificed. It is an error of disguised selfishness, the
  counterpart of the carelessness with which in our own age, when we are
  ourselves constituents of an interested public, we ignore what it is
  inconvenient to remember.</p>

  <p>Thus, therefore, on one hot Midsummer Sunday in this year 1533, the
  people gathering to church in every parish through the English counties,
  read, nailed upon the doors, a paper signed Henry R., setting forth that
  the Lady Catherine of Spain, heretofore called Queen of England, was not
  to be called by that title any more, but was to be called Princess
  Dowager, and so to be held and esteemed. The proclamation, we may
  suppose, was read with varying comments; of the reception of it in the
  northern counties, the following information was forwarded to the crown.
  The Earl of Derby, lord-lieutenant of Yorkshire, wrote to inform the
  council that he had arrested a certain "lewd and naughty priest," James
  Harrison by name, on the charge of having spoken unfitting and slanderous
  words of his Highness and the Queen's Grace. He had taken the
  examinations of several witnesses, which he had sent with his letter, and
  which were to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Richard Clark deposeth that the said James Harrison reading the
  proclamation, said that Queen Catherine was queen, Nan Bullen should not
  be queen, nor the king should be no king but on his bearing.</p>

  <p>William Dalton deposeth, that in his hearing the above-named James
  said, I will take none for queen but Queen Catherine&mdash;who the devil
  made Nan Bullen, that hoore, queen? I will never take her for
  queen&mdash;and he the said William answered, "Hold thy peace, thou
  wot'st not what thou sayest&mdash;but that <!-- Page 289 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span> thou art a priest I
  should punish thee, that others should take example."</p>

  <p>Richard Sumner and John Clayton depose, that they came in company with
  the said James from Perbalt to Eccleston, when the said James did say,
  "This is a marvellous world&mdash;the king will put down the order of
  priests and destroy the Sacrament, but he cannot reign long, for York
  will be in London hastily."<a name="NtA_443"></a><a
  href="#Nt_443"><sup>443</sup></a></p>

  <p>Here was the later growth of the spirit which we saw a few months
  previously in the monks of Furness. The mutterings of discontent had
  developed into plain open treason, confident of success, and scarcely
  caring to conceal itself&mdash;and Yorkshire was preparing for rebellion
  and "the Pilgrimage of Grace."</p>

  <p>There is another quarter also into which we must follow the
  proclamation, and watch the effect of the royal order in a scene where it
  is well that we should for a few moments rest. Catherine was still at
  Ampthill, surrounded by her own attendants, who formed an inner circle,
  shielding her retirement against impertinent curiosity. She rarely or
  never allowed herself to be seen; Lord Mountjoy, with an official
  retinue, was in attendance in the house; but the occupation was not a
  pleasant one, and he was as willing to respect the queen's seclusion as
  she to remain secluded. Injunctions arrived however from the court at the
  end of June, which compelled him to request an interview; a deputation of
  the privy council had come down to inform the ex-queen of the orders of
  the government, and to desire that they might be put in force in her own
  family. Aware probably of the nature of the communication which was to be
  made to her, she refused repeatedly to admit them to her presence. At
  length, however, she nerved herself for the effort, and on the 3rd of
  July Mountjoy and the state commissioners were informed that she was
  ready to receive them.</p>

  <p>As they entered her room she was lying on a sofa. She had a bad cough,
  and she had hurt her foot with a pin, and was unable to stand or walk.
  Her attendants were all present by her own desire; she was glad to see
  around her some sympathising human faces, to enable her to endure the
  cold hard eyes of the officials of the council.</p>

  <p>She inquired whether the message was to be delivered in writing or by
  word of mouth.</p>

  <p>They replied that they had brought with them instructions <!-- Page
  290 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span> which
  they were to read, and that they were further charged with a message
  which was to be delivered verbally. She desired that they would read
  their written despatch. It was addressed to the Princess Dowager, and she
  at once excepted to the name. She was not Princess Dowager, she said, but
  queen, and the king's true wife. She came to the king a clear maid for
  any bodily knowledge of Prince Arthur; she had borne him lawful issue and
  no bastard, and therefore queen she was, and queen she would be while she
  lived.</p>

  <p>The commissioners were prepared for the objection, and continued,
  without replying, to read. The paper contained a statement of worn-out
  unrealities; the old story of the judgment of the universities and the
  learned men, the sentence of convocation, and of the houses of
  parliament; and, finally, the fact of substantial importance, that the
  king, acting as he believed according to the laws of God, had married the
  Lady Anne Boleyn, who was now his lawful wife, and anointed Queen of
  England.</p>

  <p>Oh yes, she answered when they had done, we know that, and "we know
  the authority by which it has been done&mdash;more by power than
  justice." The king's learned men were learned heretics; the honest
  learning was for her. As for the seals of the universities there were
  strange stories about the way in which they had been obtained. The
  universities and the parliament had done what the king bade them; and
  they had gone against their consciences in doing it; but it was of no
  importance to her&mdash;she was in the hands of the pope, who was God's
  vicar, and she acknowledged no other judge.</p>

  <p>The commissioners informed her of the decision of the council that she
  was no longer to bear the title of queen. It stood, they said, neither
  with the laws of God nor man, nor with the king's honour, to have two
  queens named within the realm; and in fact, there was but one queen, the
  king's lawful wife, to whom he was now married.</p>

  <p>She replied shortly that she was the king's lawful queen, and none
  other.</p>

  <p>There was little hope in her manner that anything which could be said
  would move her; but her visitors were ordered to try her to the
  uttermost.</p>

  <p>The king, they continued, was surprised that she could be so
  disobedient; and not only that she was disobedient herself, but that she
  allowed and encouraged her servants in the same conduct.</p>

<!-- Page 291 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>[pg 291]</span>

  <p>She was ready to obey the king; she answered, when she could do so
  without disobeying God; but she could not damn her soul even for him. Her
  servants, she said, must do the best they could; they were standing round
  her as she was speaking; and she turned to them with an apology, and a
  hope that they would pardon her. She would hinder her cause, she said;
  and put her soul in danger, if on their account she were to relinquish
  her name, and she could not do it.</p>

  <p>The deputation next attempted her on her worldly side. If she would
  obey, they informed her that she would be allowed not only her jointure
  as Princess Dowager and her own private fortune, but all the settlements
  which had been made upon her on her marriage with the king.</p>

  <p>She "passed not upon possessions, in regard of this matter," she
  replied. It touched her conscience, and no worldly considerations were of
  the slightest moment.</p>

  <p>In disobeying the king, they said; seeing that she was none other than
  his subject, she might give cause for dissension and disturbance; and she
  might lose the favour of the people.</p>

  <p>She "trusted not," she replied&mdash;she "never minded it, nor would
  she"&mdash;she "desired only to save her right; and if she should lose
  the favour of the people in defending that right, yet she trusted to go
  to heaven cum famâ et infamiâ."</p>

  <p>Promises and persuasions being unavailing, they tried threats. She was
  told that if she persisted in so obstinate a course, the king would be
  obliged to make known to the world the offers which he had made to her,
  and the ill reception which they had met with&mdash;and then he would
  perhaps withdraw those offers, and conceive some evil opinions of high
  displeasure towards her.</p>

  <p>She answered that there was no manner of offers neither of lands nor
  goods that she had respect unto in comparison of her cause&mdash;and as
  to the loss of the king's affection, she trusted to God, to whom she
  would daily pray for him.</p>

  <p>The learned council might as well have reasoned with the winds; or
  threatened the waves of the sea. But they were not yet weary, and their
  next effort was as foolish as it was ungenerous. They suggested, "that if
  she did reserve the name of queen, it was thought that she would do it of
  a vain desire and appetite of glory; and further, she might be an
  occasion that the king would withdraw his love from her most dear
  daughter the Lady Princess, which should chiefly move her, if none other
  cause did."</p>

<!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span>

  <p>They must have known little of Catherine, if they thought she could be
  influenced by childish vanity. It was for no vain glory that she cared,
  she answered proudly; she was the king's true wife, and her conscience
  forbade her to call herself otherwise; the princess was his true begotten
  child; and as God hath given her to them, so for her part she would
  render her again; neither for daughter, family, nor possessions, would
  she yield in her cause; and she made a solemn protestation, calling on
  every one present to bear witness to what she said, that the king's wife
  she was, and such she would take herself to be, and that she would never
  surrender the name of queen till the pope had decided that she must bear
  it no longer.</p>

  <p>So ended the first interview. Catherine, before the commissioners left
  her, desired to have a copy of the proposals which they had brought, that
  she might translate and send them to Rome. They returned with them the
  next day, when she requested to see the report which they intended to
  send to the council of the preceding conversation. It was placed in her
  hands; and as she read it and found there the name of Princess Dowager,
  she took a pen and dashed out the words, the mark of which indignant
  ink-stroke may now be seen in the letter from which this account is
  taken.<a name="NtA_444"></a><a href="#Nt_444"><sup>444</sup></a> With the
  accuracy of the rest she appeared to be satisfied&mdash;only when she
  found again their poor suggestion that she was influenced by vanity, she
  broke out with a burst of passionate indignation.</p>

  <p>"I would rather be a poor beggar's wife," she said, "and be sure of
  heaven, than queen of all the world, and stand in doubt thereof by reason
  of my own consent. I stick not so for vain glory, but because I know
  myself the king's true wife&mdash;and while you call me the king's
  subject, I was his subject while he took me for his wife. But if he take
  me not for his wife, I came not into this Realm as merchandise, nor to be
  married to any merchant; nor do I continue in the same but as his lawful
  wife, and not as a subject to live under his dominion otherwise. I have
  always demeaned myself well and truly towards the king&mdash;and if it
  can be proved that either in writing to the pope or any other, I have
  either stirred or procured anything against his Grace, or have been the
  means to any person to make any motion which might be prejudicial to his
  Grace or to his Realm, I am content to suffer for it. I have done England
  little good, and I should be sorry to do it any harm. But if I should
  agree to your motions and persuasions, I should slander myself, and <!--
  Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span>
  confess to have been the king's harlot for twenty-four years. The cause,
  I cannot tell by what subtle means, has been determined here within the
  king's Realm, before a man of his own making, the Bishop of Canterbury,
  no person indifferent I think in that behalf; and for the indifference of
  the place, I think the place had been more indifferent to have been
  judged in hell; for no truth can be suffered here, whereas the devils
  themselves I suppose do tremble to see the truth in this cause so sore
  oppressed."<a name="NtA_445"></a><a href="#Nt_445"><sup>445</sup></a></p>

  <p>Most noble, spirited, and like a queen. Yet she would never have been
  brought to this extremity, and she would have shown a truer nobleness, if
  four years before she could have yielded at the pope's entreaty on the
  first terms which were proposed to her. Those terms would have required
  no humiliating confessions; they would have involved no sentence on her
  marriage nor touched her daughter's legitimacy. She would have broken no
  law of God, nor seemed to break it. She was required only to forget her
  own interests; and she would not forget them, though all the world should
  be wrecked by her refusal. She denied that she was concerned in "motions
  prejudicial to the king or to the Realm," but she must have placed her
  own interpretation on the words, and would have considered
  excommunication and interdict a salutary discipline to the king and
  parliament. She knew that this sentence was imminent, that in its minor
  form it had already fallen; and she knew that her nephew and her friends
  in England were plotting to give effect to the decree. But we may pass
  over this. It is not for an English writer to dwell upon those faults of
  Catherine of Arragon, which English remorse has honourably insisted on
  forgetting. Her injuries, inevitable as they were, and forced upon her in
  great measure by her own wilfulness, remain among the saddest spots in
  the pages of our history.</p>

  <p>One other brief incident remains to be noticed here, to bring up
  before the imagination the features of this momentous summer. It is
  contained in the postscript of a letter of Cranmer to Hawkins the
  ambassador in Germany; and the manner in which the story is told is no
  less suggestive than the story itself.</p>

  <p>The immediate present, however awful its import, will ever seem common
  and familiar to those who live and breathe in the midst of it. In the
  days of the September massacre at Paris, the theatres were open as usual;
  men ate, and drank, and laughed, and cried, and went about their common
  work, unconscious <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span> that those days which were passing by
  them, so much like other days, would remain the <i>dies nefasti</i>,
  accursed in the memory of mankind for ever. Nothing is terrible, nothing
  is sublime in human things, so long as they are before our eyes. The
  great man has so much in common with men in general, the routine of daily
  life, in periods the most remarkable in history, contains so much that is
  unvarying, that it is only when time has done its work; and all which was
  unimportant has ceased to be remembered, that such men and such times
  stand out in their true significance. It might have been thought that to
  a person like Cranmer, the court at Dunstable, the coronation of the new
  queen, the past out of which these things had risen, and the future which
  they threatened to involve, would have seemed at least serious; and that
  engaged as he had been as a chief actor, in a matter which, if it had
  done nothing else, had broken the heart of a high-born lady whom once he
  had honoured as his queen, he would have been either silent about his
  exploits, or if he had spoken of them, would have spoken not without some
  show of emotion. We look for a symptom of feeling, but we do not find it.
  When the coronation festivities were concluded he wrote to his friend an
  account of what had been done by himself and others in the light
  gossiping tone of easiest content; as if he were describing the common
  incidents of a common day. It is disappointing, and not wholly to be
  approved of. Still less can we approve of the passage with which he
  concludes his letter.</p>

  <p>"Other news we have none notable, but that one Frith, which was in the
  Tower in prison,<a name="NtA_446"></a><a
  href="#Nt_446"><sup>446</sup></a> was appointed by the King's Grace to be
  examined before me, my Lord of London, my Lord of Winchester, my Lord of
  Suffolk, my Lord Chancellor, and my Lord of Wiltshire; whose opinion was
  so notably erroneous that we could not dispatch him, but were fain to
  leave him to the determination of his ordinary, which is the Bishop of
  London. His said opinion is of such nature, that he thought it not
  necessary to be believed as an article of our faith that there is the
  very corporeal presence of Christ within the host and sacrament of the
  altar; and holdeth on this point much after the opinion of
  &#338;colampadius.</p>

<!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span>

  <p>"And surely I myself sent for him three or four times to persuade him
  to leave that imagination. But for all that we could do therein, he would
  not apply to any counsel. Notwithstanding now he is at a final end with
  all examinations; for my Lord of London hath given sentence, and
  delivered him to the secular power when he looketh every day to go unto
  the fire. And there is also condemned with him one Andrew a tailor for
  the self-same opinion; and thus fare you well."<a name="NtA_447"></a><a
  href="#Nt_447"><sup>447</sup></a></p>

  <p>These victims went as they were sentenced, dismissed to their martyr's
  crowns at Smithfield, as Queen Anne Boleyn but a few days before had
  received her golden crown at the altar of Westminster Abbey. Twenty years
  later another fire was blazing under the walls of Oxford; and the hand
  which was now writing these light lines was blackening in the flames of
  it, paying there the penalty of the same "imagination" for which Frith
  and the poor London tailor were with such cool indifference condemned. It
  is affecting to know that Frith's writings were the instruments of
  Cranmer's conversion; and the fathers of the Anglican church have left a
  monument of their sorrow for the shedding of this innocent blood in the
  Order of the Communion service, which closes with the very words on which
  the primate, with his brother bishops, had sate in judgment.<a

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE PROTESTANTS</h3>

  <p>Where changes are about to take place of great and enduring moment, a
  kind of prologue, on a small scale, sometimes anticipates the true
  opening of the drama; like the first drops which give notice of the
  coming storm, or as if the shadows of the reality were projected forwards
  into the future, and imitated in dumb show the movements of the real
  actors in the story.</p>

  <p>Such a rehearsal of the English Reformation was witnessed at the close
  of the fourteenth century, confused, imperfect, disproportioned, to
  outward appearance barren of results; yet containing a representative of
  each one of the mixed forces by which that great change was ultimately
  effected, and foreshadowing even something of the course which it was to
  run.</p>

  <p>There was a quarrel with the pope upon the extent of the papal
  privileges; there were disputes between the laity and the
  clergy,&mdash;accompanied, as if involuntarily, by attacks on the
  sacramental system and the Catholic faith,&mdash;while innovation in
  doctrine was accompanied also with the tendency which characterised the
  extreme development of the later Protestants&mdash;towards political
  republicanism, the fifth monarchy, and community of goods. Some account
  of this movement must be given in this place, although it can be but a
  sketch only. "Lollardry"<a name="NtA_449"></a><a
  href="#Nt_449"><sup>449</sup></a> has a history of its own; but it forms
  no proper part of the history of the Reformation. It was a separate
  phenomenon, provoked by the same causes which produced their true fruit
  at a later period; but it formed no portion of the stem on which those
  fruits ultimately grew. It was a prelude which was played out, and sank
  into silence, answering for the time no other end than to make the name
  of heretic odious in the ears of the English nation. In their recoil from
  their first failure, the people stamped their hatred of heterodoxy into
  their language; and in the word <i>miscreant</i>, misbeliever, as the
  synonym <!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>[pg
  297]</span> of the worst species of reprobate, they left an indelible
  record of the popular estimate of the followers of John Wycliffe.</p>

  <p>The Lollard story opens with the disputes between the crown and the
  see of Rome on the presentation to English benefices. For the hundred and
  fifty years which succeeded the Conquest, the right of nominating the
  archbishops, the bishops, and the mitred abbots, had been claimed and
  exercised by the crown. On the passing of the great charter, the church
  had recovered its liberties, and the privilege of free election had been
  conceded by a special clause to the clergy. The practice which then
  became established was in accordance with the general spirit of the
  English constitution. On the vacancy of a see, the cathedral chapter
  applied to the crown for a congé d'élire. The application was a form; the
  consent was invariable. A bishop was then elected by a majority of
  suffrages; his name was submitted to the metropolitan, and by him to the
  pope. If the pope signified his approval, the election was complete;
  consecration followed; and the bishop having been furnished with his
  bulls of investiture, was presented to the king, and from him received
  "the temporalities" of his see. The mode in which the great abbots were
  chosen was precisely similar; the superiors of the orders to which the
  abbeys belonged were the channels of communication with the pope, in the
  place of the archbishops; but the elections in themselves were free, and
  were conducted in the same manner. The smaller church benefices, the
  small monasteries or parish churches, were in the hands of private
  patrons, lay or ecclesiastical; but in the case of each institution a
  reference was admitted, or was supposed to be admitted, to the court of
  Rome.</p>

  <p>There was thus in the pope's hand an authority of an indefinite kind,
  which it was presumed that his sacred office would forbid him to abuse,
  but which, however, if he so unfortunately pleased, he might abuse at his
  discretion. He had absolute power over every nomination to an English
  benefice; he might refuse his consent till such adequate reasons,
  material or spiritual, as he considered sufficient to induce him to
  acquiesce, had been submitted to his consideration. In the case of
  nominations to the religious houses, the superiors of the various orders
  residing abroad had equal facilities for obstructiveness; and the
  consequence of so large a confidence in the purity of the higher orders
  of the Church became visible in an act of parliament which it was found
  necessary to pass in 1306-7.<a name="NtA_450"></a><a

<!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span>

  <p>"Of late," says this act, "it has come to the knowledge of the king,
  by the grievous complaint of the honourable persons, lords, and other
  noblemen of his realm, that whereas monasteries, priories, and other
  religious houses were founded to the honour and glory of God, and the
  advancement of holy church, by the king and his progenitors, and by the
  said noblemen and their ancestors; and a very great portion of lands and
  tenements have been given by them to the said monasteries, priories, and
  religious houses, and the religious men serving God in them; to the
  intent that clerks and laymen might be admitted in such houses, and that
  sick and feeble folk might be maintained, hospitality, almsgiving, and
  other charitable deeds might be done, and prayers be said for the souls
  of the founders and their heirs; the abbots, priors, and governors of the
  said houses, <i>and certain aliens their superiors</i>, as the abbots and
  priors of the Cistertians, the Premonstrants, the orders of Saint
  Augustine and of Saint Benedict, and many more of other religions and
  orders have at their own pleasure set divers heavy, unwonted heavy and
  importable tallages, payments, and impositions upon every of the said
  monasteries and houses subject unto them, in England, Ireland, Scotland,
  and Wales, without the privity of the king and his nobility, contrary to
  the laws and customs of the said realm; and thereby the number of
  religious persons being oppressed by such tallages, payments, and
  impositions, the service of God is diminished, alms are not given to the
  poor, the sick, and the feeble; the healths of the living and the souls
  of the dead be miserably defrauded; hospitality, alms-giving, and other
  godly deeds do cease; and so that which in times past was charitably
  given to godly uses and to the service of God, is now converted to an
  evil end, by permission whereof there groweth great scandal to the
  people." To provide against a continuance of these abuses, it was enacted
  that no "religious" persons should, under any pretence or form, send out
  of the kingdom any kind of tax, rent, or tallage; and that "priors
  aliens" should not presume to assess any payment, charge, or other burden
  whatever upon houses within the realm.<a name="NtA_451"></a><a
  href="#Nt_451"><sup>451</sup></a></p>

  <p>The language of this act was studiously guarded. The pope was not
  alluded to; the specific methods by which the extortion was practised
  were not explained; the tax upon presentations to benefices, either
  having not yet distinguished itself beyond other impositions, or the
  government trusting that a measure of this general kind might answer the
  desired end. Lucrative <!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span> encroachments, however, do not yield
  so easily to treatment; nearly fifty years after it became necessary to
  re-enact the same statute; and while recapitulating the provisions of it,
  the parliament found it desirable to point out more specifically the
  intention with which it was passed.</p>

  <p>The popes in the interval had absorbed in their turn from the heads of
  the religious orders, the privileges which by them had been extorted from
  the affiliated societies. Each English benefice had become the fountain
  of a rivulet which flowed into the Roman exchequer, or a property to be
  distributed as the private patronage of the Roman bishop: and the English
  parliament for the first time found itself in collision with the Father
  of Christendom.</p>

  <p>"The pope," says the fourth of the twenty-fifth of Edward III.,
  "accroaching to himself the signories of the benefices within the realm
  of England, doth give and grant the same to aliens which did never dwell
  in England, and to cardinals which could not dwell here, and to others as
  well aliens as denizens, whereby manifold inconveniences have ensued."
  "Not regarding" the statute of Edward I., he had also continued to
  present to bishopricks, abbeys, priories, and other valuable preferments:
  money in large quantities was carried out of the realm from the proceeds
  of these offices, and it was necessary to insist emphatically that the
  papal nominations should cease. They were made in violation of the law,
  and were conducted with simony so flagrant that English benefices were
  sold in the papal courts to any person who would pay for them, whether an
  Englishman or a stranger. It was therefore decreed that the elections to
  bishopricks should be free as in time past, that the rights of patrons
  should be preserved, and penalties of imprisonment, forfeiture, or
  outlawry, according to the complexion of the offence, should be attached
  to all impetration of benefices from Rome by purchase or otherwise.<a
  name="NtA_452"></a><a href="#Nt_452"><sup>452</sup></a></p>

  <p>If statute law could have touched the evil, these enactments would
  have been sufficient for the purpose; but the influence of the popes in
  England was of that subtle kind which was not so <!-- Page 300 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span> readily defeated.
  The law was still defied, or still evaded; and the struggle continued
  till the close of the century, the legislature labouring patiently, but
  ineffectually, to confine with fresh enactments their ingenious
  adversary.<a name="NtA_453"></a><a href="#Nt_453"><sup>453</sup></a></p>

  <p>At length symptoms appeared of an intention on the part of the popes
  to maintain their claims with spiritual censures, and the nation was
  obliged to resolve upon the course which, in the event of their resorting
  to that extremity, it would follow. The lay lords<a name="NtA_454"></a><a
  href="#Nt_454"><sup>454</sup></a> and the House of Commons found no
  difficulty in arriving at a conclusion. They passed a fresh penal statute
  with prohibitions even more emphatically stringent, and decided that "if
  any man brought into this realm any sentence, summons, or
  excommunication, contrary to the effect of the statute, he should incur
  pain of life and members, with forfeiture of goods; and if any prelate
  made execution of such sentence, his temporalities should be taken from
  him, and should abide in the king's hands till redress was made."<a
  name="NtA_455"></a><a href="#Nt_455"><sup>455</sup></a></p>

  <p>So bold a measure threatened nothing less than open rupture. The act,
  however, seems to have been passed in haste, without determined
  consideration; and on second thoughts, it was held more prudent to
  attempt a milder course. The strength of the opposition to the papacy lay
  with the Commons.<a name="NtA_456"></a><a
  href="#Nt_456"><sup>456</sup></a> When the session of parliament was
  over, a great council was summoned to reconsider what should be done, and
  an address was drawn up, and forwarded to Rome, with a request that the
  then reigning pope would devise some manner by which the difficulty could
  be arranged.<a name="NtA_457"></a><a href="#Nt_457"><sup>457</sup></a>
  Boniface IX. replied with the same want of judgment which was shown
  afterwards on an analogous occasion <!-- Page 301 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span> by Clement VII. He
  disbelieved the danger; and daring the government to persevere, he
  granted a prebendal stall at Wells to an Italian cardinal, to which a
  presentation had been made already by the king. Opposing suits were
  instantly instituted between the claimants in the courts of the two
  countries. A decision was given in England in favour of the nominee of
  the king, and the bishops agreeing to support the crown were
  excommunicated.<a name="NtA_458"></a><a href="#Nt_458"><sup>458</sup></a>
  The court of Rome had resolved to try the issue by a struggle of force,
  and the government had no alternative but to surrender at discretion, or
  to persevere at all hazards, and resist the usurpation.</p>

  <p>The proceedings on this occasion seem to have been unusual, and
  significant of the importance of the crisis. Parliament either was
  sitting at the time when the excommunication was issued, or else it was
  immediately assembled; and the House of Commons drew up, in the form of a
  petition to the king, a declaration of the circumstances which had
  occurred. After having stated generally the English law on the
  presentation to benefices, "Now of late," they added, "divers processes
  be made by his Holiness the Pope, and censures of excommunication upon
  certain bishops, because they have made execution of the judgments [given
  in the king's courts], to the open disherison of the crown; whereby, if
  remedy be not provided, the crown of England, which hath been so free at
  all times, that it has been in no earthly subjection, should be submitted
  to the pope; and the laws and statutes of the realm by him be defeated
  and avoided at his will, in perpetual destruction of the sovereignty of
  the king our lord, his crown, his regality, and all his realm." The
  Commons, therefore, on their part, declared, "That the things so
  attempted were clearly against the king's crown and his regality, used
  and approved of in the time of all his progenitors, and therefore they
  and all the liege commons of the realm would stand with their said lord
  the king, and his said crown, in the cases aforesaid, to live and die."<a
  name="NtA_459"></a><a href="#Nt_459"><sup>459</sup></a> Whether they made
  allusion to the act of 1389 does not appear&mdash;a measure passed under
  protest from one of the estates of the realm was possibly held unequal to
  meet the emergency&mdash;at all events they would not rely upon it. For
  after this peremptory assertion of their own opinion, they desired the
  king, "and required <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span> him in the way of justice," to examine
  severally the lords spiritual and temporal how they thought, and how they
  would stand.<a name="NtA_460"></a><a href="#Nt_460"><sup>460</sup></a>
  The examination was made, and the result was satisfactory. The lay lords
  replied without reservation that they would support the crown. The
  bishops (they were in a difficulty for which all allowance must be made)
  gave a cautious, but also a manly answer. They would not affirm, they
  said, that the pope had a right to excommunicate them in such cases, and
  they would not say that he had not. It was clear, however, that legal or
  illegal, such excommunication was against the privileges of the English
  crown, and therefore that, on the whole, they would and ought to be with
  the crown, <i>loialment</i>, like loyal subjects, as they were bound by
  their allegiance.<a name="NtA_461"></a><a
  href="#Nt_461"><sup>461</sup></a></p>

  <p>In this unusual and emphatic manner, the three estates agreed that the
  pope should be resisted; and an act passed "that all persons suing at the
  court of Rome, and obtaining thence any bulls, instruments, sentences of
  excommunication which touched the king, or were against him, his
  regality, or his realm, and they which brought the same within the realm,
  or received the same, or made thereof notification, or any other
  execution whatever, within the realm or without, they, their notaries,
  procurators, maintainers and abettors, fautors and counsellors, should be
  put out of the king's protection, and their lands and tenements, goods
  and chattels, be forfeited."</p>

  <p>The resolute attitude of the country terminated the struggle. Boniface
  prudently yielded, and for the moment; and indeed for ever under this
  especial form, the wave of papal encroachment was rolled back. The temper
  which had been roused in the contest, might perhaps have carried the
  nation further. The liberties of the crown had been asserted
  successfully. The analogous liberties of the church might have followed;
  and other channels, too, might have been cut off, through which the papal
  exchequer fed itself on English blood. But at this crisis the anti-Roman
  policy was arrested in its course by another movement, which turned the
  current of suspicion, and frightened back the nation to conservatism.</p>

  <p>While the crown and the parliament had been engaged with the pope, the
  undulations of the dispute had penetrated down among the body of the
  people, and an agitation had been commenced of an analogous kind against
  the spiritual authorities at home. The parliament had lamented that the
  duties of the religious houses were left unfulfilled, in consequence of
  the extortions <!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span> of their superiors abroad. The people,
  who were equally convinced of the neglect of duty, adopted an
  interpretation of the phenomenon less favourable to the clergy, and
  attributed it to the temptations of worldliness, and the self-indulgence
  generated by enormous wealth.</p>

  <p>This form of discontent found its exponent in John Wycliffe, the great
  forerunner of the Reformation, whose austere figure stands out above the
  crowd of notables in English history, with an outline not unlike that of
  another forerunner of a greater change.</p>

  <p>The early life of Wycliffe is obscure. Lewis, on the authority of
  Leland,<a name="NtA_462"></a><a href="#Nt_462"><sup>462</sup></a> says
  that he was born near Richmond, in Yorkshire. Fuller, though with some
  hesitation, prefers Durham.<a name="NtA_463"></a><a
  href="#Nt_463"><sup>463</sup></a> He emerges into distinct notice in
  1360, ten years subsequent to the passing of the first Statute of
  Provisors, having then acquired a great Oxford reputation as a lecturer
  in divinity, and having earned for himself powerful friends and powerful
  enemies. He had made his name distinguished by attacks upon the clergy
  for their indolence and profligacy: attacks both written and orally
  delivered&mdash;those written, we observe, being written in English, not
  in Latin.<a name="NtA_464"></a><a href="#Nt_464"><sup>464</sup></a> In
  1365, Islip, Archbishop of Canterbury, appointed him Warden of Canterbury
  Hall; the appointment, however, was made with some irregularity, and the
  following year, Archbishop Islip dying, his successor, Langham, deprived
  Wycliffe, and the sentence was confirmed by the king. It seemed,
  nevertheless, that no personal reflection was intended by this decision,
  for Edward III. nominated the ex-warden one of his chaplains immediately
  after, and employed him on an important mission to Bruges, where a
  conference on the benefice question was to be held with a papal
  commission.</p>

  <p>Other church preferment was subsequently given to Wycliffe; but Oxford
  remained the chief scene of his work. He continued to hold his
  professorship of divinity; and from this office the character of his
  history took its complexion. At a time when books were rare and difficult
  to be procured, lecturers who had truth to communicate fresh drawn from
  the fountain, held an influence which in these days it is as difficult to
  imagine as, however, it is impossible to overrate. Students from all
  Europe <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"></a>[pg
  304]</span> flocked to the feet of a celebrated professor, who became the
  leader of a party by the mere fact of his position.</p>

  <p>The burden of Wycliffe's teaching was the exposure of the indolent
  fictions which passed under the name of religion in the established
  theory of the church. He was a man of most simple life; austere in
  appearance, with bare feet and russet mantle.<a name="NtA_465"></a><a
  href="#Nt_465"><sup>465</sup></a> As a soldier of Christ, he saw in his
  Great Master and his Apostles the patterns whom he was bound to imitate.
  By the contagion of example he gathered about him other men who thought
  as he did; and gradually, under his captaincy, these "poor priests," as
  they were called&mdash;vowed to poverty because Christ was
  poor&mdash;vowed to accept no benefice, lest they should misspend the
  property of the poor, and because, as apostles, they were bound to go
  where their Master called them,<a name="NtA_466"></a><a
  href="#Nt_466"><sup>466</sup></a> spread out over the country as an army
  of missionaries, to preach the faith which they found in the
  Bible&mdash;to preach, not of relics and of indulgences, but of
  repentance and of the grace of God. They carried with them copies of the
  Bible which Wycliffe had translated, leaving here and there, as they
  travelled, their costly treasures, as shining seed points of light; and
  they refused to recognise the authority of the bishops, or their right to
  silence them.</p>

  <p>If this had been all, and perhaps if Edward III. had been succeeded by
  a prince less miserably incapable than his grandson Richard, Wycliffe
  might have made good his ground; the movement of the parliament against
  the pope might have united in a common stream with the spiritual move
  against the church at home, and the Reformation have been antedated by a
  century. He was summoned to answer for himself before the Archbishop of
  Canterbury in 1377. He appeared in court supported by the presence of
  John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the eldest of Edward's surviving sons,
  and the authorities were unable to strike him behind so powerful a
  shield.</p>

  <p>But the "poor priests" had other doctrines besides those which they
  discovered in the Bible, relating to subjects with which, as apostles,
  they would have done better if they had shrunk from meddling. The
  inefficiency of the clergy was occasioned, as Wycliffe thought, by their
  wealth and by their luxury. He desired to save them from a temptation too
  heavy for them to bear, and he insisted that by neglect of duty their
  wealth had been forfeited, and that it was the business of the laity to
  take it from its unworthy possessors. The invectives with which the <!--
  Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span>
  argument was accompanied produced a widely-spread irritation. The reins
  of the country fell simultaneously into the weak hands of Richard II.,
  and the consequence was a rapid spread of disorder. In the year which
  followed Richard's accession, consistory judges were assaulted in their
  courts, sanctuaries were violated, priests were attacked and ill-treated
  in church, church-yard, and cathedral, and even while engaged in the
  mass;<a name="NtA_467"></a><a href="#Nt_467"><sup>467</sup></a> the
  contagion of the growing anarchy seems to have touched even Wycliffe
  himself, and touched him in a point most deeply dangerous.</p>

  <p>His theory of property, and his study of the character of Christ, had
  led him to the near confines of Anabaptism. Expanding his views upon the
  estates of the church into an axiom, he taught that "charters of
  perpetual inheritance were impossible;" "that God could not give men
  civil possessions for ever;"<a name="NtA_468"></a><a
  href="#Nt_468"><sup>468</sup></a> "that property was founded in grace,
  and derived from God;" and "seeing that forfeiture was the punishment of
  treason, and all sin was treason against God, the sinner must
  consequently forfeit his right to what he held of God." These
  propositions were nakedly true, as we shall most of us allow; but God has
  his own methods of enforcing extreme principles; and human legislation
  may only meddle with them at its peril. The theory as an abstraction
  could be represented as applying equally to the laity as to the clergy,
  and the new teaching received a practical comment in 1381, in the
  invasion of London by Wat, the tyler of Dartford, and 100,000 men, who
  were to level all ranks, put down the church, and establish universal
  liberty.<a name="NtA_469"></a><a href="#Nt_469"><sup>469</sup></a> Two
  priests accompanied the insurgents, not Wycliffe's followers, but the
  licentious counterfeits of them, who trod inevitably in their footsteps,
  and were as inevitably countenanced by their doctrines. The insurrection
  was attended with the bloodshed, destruction, and ferocity natural to
  such outbreaks. The Archbishop of Canterbury and many gentlemen were
  murdered; and a great part of London sacked and burnt. It would be absurd
  to attribute this disaster to Wycliffe, nor was there any desire to hold
  him responsible for it; but it is equally certain that the doctrines
  which he had taught were incompatible, at that particular time, with an
  effective repression of the spirit which had caused the explosion. It is
  equally certain that he had brought <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>[pg 306]</span> discredit on his
  nobler efforts by ambiguous language on a subject of the utmost
  difficulty, and had taught the wiser and better portion of the people to
  confound heterodoxy of opinion with sedition, anarchy, and disorder.</p>

  <p>So long as Wycliffe lived, his own lofty character was a guarantee for
  the conduct of his immediate disciples; and although his favour had far
  declined, a party in the state remained attached to him, with sufficient
  influence to prevent the adoption of extreme measures against the "poor
  priests." In the year following the insurrection, an act was passed for
  their repression in the House of Lords, and was sent down by the king to
  the Commons. They were spoken of as "evil persons," going from place to
  place in defiance of the bishops, preaching in the open air to great
  congregations at markets and fairs, "exciting the people," "engendering
  discord between the estates of the realm." The ordinaries had no power to
  silence them, and had therefore desired that commissions should be issued
  to the sheriffs of the various counties, to arrest all such persons, and
  confine them, until they would "justify themselves" in the ecclesiastical
  courts.<a name="NtA_470"></a><a href="#Nt_470"><sup>470</sup></a>
  Wycliffe petitioned against the bill, and it was rejected; not so much
  perhaps out of tenderness for the reformer, as because the Lower House
  was excited by the controversy with the pope; and being doubtfully
  disposed towards the clergy, was reluctant to subject the people to a
  more stringent spiritual control.</p>

  <p>But Wycliffe himself meanwhile had received a clear intimation of his
  own declining position. His opposition to the church authorities, and his
  efforts at re-invigorating the faith of the country, had led him into
  doubtful statements on the nature of the eucharist; he had entangled
  himself in dubious metaphysics on a subject on which no middle course is
  really possible; and being summoned to answer for his language before a
  synod in London, he had thrown himself again for protection on the Duke
  of Lancaster. The duke (not unnaturally under the circumstances) declined
  to encourage what he could neither approve nor understand;<a
  name="NtA_471"></a><a href="#Nt_471"><sup>471</sup></a> and Wycliffe, by
  his great patron's advice, submitted. He read a confession of faith
  before the bishops, which was held satisfactory; he was forbidden,
  however, to preach again in Oxford, and retired to his living of
  Lutterworth, in Leicestershire, where two years later he died.</p>

  <p>With him departed all which was best and purest in the movement which
  he had commenced. The zeal of his followers was <!-- Page 307 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span> not extinguished,
  but the wisdom was extinguished which had directed it; and perhaps the
  being treated as the enemies of order had itself a tendency to make them
  what they were believed to be. They were left unmolested for the next
  twenty years, the feebleness of the government, the angry complexion
  which had been assumed by the dispute with Rome, and the political
  anarchy in the closing decade of the century, combining to give them
  temporary shelter; but they availed themselves of their opportunity to
  travel further on the dangerous road on which they had entered; and on
  the settlement of the country under Henry IV. they fell under the general
  ban which struck down all parties who had shared in the late
  disturbances.</p>

  <p>They had been spared in 1382, only for more sharp denunciation, and a
  more cruel fate; and Boniface having healed, on his side, the wounds
  which had been opened, by well-timed concessions, there was no reason
  left for leniency. The character of the Lollard teaching was thus
  described (perhaps in somewhat exaggerated language) in the preamble of
  the act of 1401.<a name="NtA_472"></a><a
  href="#Nt_472"><sup>472</sup></a></p>

  <p>"Divers false and perverse people," so runs the act <i>De Heretico
  comburendo</i>, "of a certain new sect, damnably thinking of the faith of
  the sacraments of the church, and of the authority of the same, against
  the law of God and of the church, usurping the office of preaching, do
  perversely and maliciously, in divers places within the realm, preach and
  teach divers new doctrines, and wicked erroneous opinions, contrary to
  the faith and determination of Holy Church. And of such sect and wicked
  doctrines they make unlawful conventicles, they hold and exercise
  schools, they make and write books, they do wickedly instruct and inform
  people, and excite and stir them to sedition and insurrection, and make
  great strife and division among the people, and other enormities horrible
  to be heard, daily do perpetrate and commit. The diocesans cannot by
  their jurisdiction spiritual, without aid of the King's Majesty,
  sufficiently correct these said false and perverse people, nor refrain
  their malice, because they do go from diocess to diocess, and will not
  appear before the said diocesans; but the jurisdiction spiritual, the
  keys of the church, and the censures of the same, do utterly contemn and
  despise; and so their wicked preachings and doctrines they do from day to
  day continue and exercise, to the destruction of all order and rule,
  right and reason."</p>

  <p>Something of these violent accusations is perhaps due to the horror
  with which false doctrine in matters of faith was looked <!-- Page 308
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>[pg 308]</span> upon in
  the Catholic church, the grace by which alone an honest life was made
  possible being held to be dependent upon orthodoxy. But the Lollards had
  become political revolutionists as well as religious reformers; the
  revolt against the spiritual authority had encouraged and countenanced a
  revolt against the secular; and we cannot be surprised, therefore, that
  these institutions should have sympathised with each other, and have
  united to repress a danger which was formidable to both.</p>

  <p>The bishops, by this act, received arbitrary power to arrest and
  imprison on suspicion, without check or restraint of law, at their will
  and pleasure. Prisoners who refused to abjure their errors, who persisted
  in heresy, or relapsed into it after abjuration, were sentenced to be
  burnt at the stake&mdash;a dreadful punishment, on the wickedness of
  which the world has long been happily agreed. Yet we must remember that
  those who condemned teachers of heresy to the flames, considered that
  heresy itself involved everlasting perdition; that they were but faintly
  imitating the severity which orthodoxy still ascribes to Almighty God
  Himself.</p>

  <p>The tide which was thus setting back in favour of the church did not
  yet, however, flow freely, and without a check. The Commons consented to
  sacrifice the heretics, but they still cast wistful looks on the lands of
  the religious houses. On two several occasions, in 1406, and again 1410,
  spoliation was debated in the Lower House, and representations were made
  upon the subject to the king.<a name="NtA_473"></a><a
  href="#Nt_473"><sup>473</sup></a> The country, too, continued to be
  agitated with war and treason; and when Henry V. became king, in 1412,
  the church was still uneasy, and the Lollards were as dangerous as ever.
  Whether by prudent conduct they might have secured a repeal of the
  persecuting act is uncertain; it is more likely, from their conduct, that
  they had made their existence incompatible with the security of any
  tolerable government.</p>

  <p>A rumour having gone abroad that the king intended to enforce the laws
  against heresy, notices were found fixed against the doors of the London
  churches, that if any such measure was attempted, a hundred thousand men
  would be in arms to oppose it. These papers were traced to Sir John
  Oldcastle, otherwise called Lord Cobham, a man whose true character is
  more difficult to distinguish, in the conflict of the evidence which has
  come down to us about him, than that of almost any noticeable person in
  history. He was perhaps no worse than a fanatic. He was certainly
  prepared, if we may trust the <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span> words of a royal proclamation (and
  Henry was personally intimate with Oldcastle, and otherwise was not
  likely to have exaggerated the charges against him), he was prepared to
  venture a rebellion, with the prospect of himself becoming the president
  of some possible Lollard commonwealth.<a name="NtA_474"></a><a
  href="#Nt_474"><sup>474</sup></a> The king, with swift decisiveness,
  annihilated the incipient treason. Oldcastle was himself arrested. He
  escaped out of the Tower into Scotland; and while Henry was absent in
  France he seems to have attempted to organise some kind of Scotch
  invasion; but he was soon after again taken on the Welsh Border, tried
  and executed. An act which was passed in 1414 described his proceedings
  as an "attempt to destroy the king, and all other manner of estates of
  the realm, as well spiritual as temporal, and also all manner of policy,
  and finally the laws of the land." The sedition was held to have
  originated in heresy, and for the better repression of such mischiefs in
  time to come, the lord chancellor, the judges, the justices of the peace,
  the sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs, and every other officer having government
  of people, were sworn on entering their office to use their best power
  and diligence to detect and prosecute all persons suspected of so heinous
  a crime.<a name="NtA_475"></a><a href="#Nt_475"><sup>475</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus perished Wycliffe's labour,&mdash;not wholly, because his
  translation of the Bible still remained a rare treasure; as seed of
  future life, which would spring again under happier circumstances. But
  the sect which he organised, the special doctrines which he set himself
  to teach, after a brief blaze of success, sank into darkness; and no
  trace remained of Lollardry except the black memory of contempt and
  hatred with which the heretics of the fourteenth century were remembered
  by the English people, long after the actual Reformation had become the
  law of the land.<a name="NtA_476"></a><a
  href="#Nt_476"><sup>476</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span>

  <p>So poor a close to a movement of so fair promise was due partly to the
  agitated temper of the times; partly, perhaps, to a want of judgment in
  Wycliffe; but chiefly and essentially because it was an untimely birth.
  Wycliffe saw the evil; he did not see the remedy; and neither in his mind
  nor in the mind of the world about him, had the problem ripened itself
  for solution. England would have gained little by the premature overthrow
  of the church, when the house out of which the evil spirit was cast out
  could have been but swept and garnished for the occupation of the seven
  devils of anarchy.</p>

  <p>The fire of heresy continued to smoulder, exploding occasionally in
  insurrection,<a name="NtA_477"></a><a href="#Nt_477"><sup>477</sup></a>
  occasionally blazing up in nobler form, when some poor seeker for the
  truth, groping for a vision of God in the darkness of the years which
  followed, found his way into that high presence through the martyr's
  fire. But substantially, the nation relapsed into obedience&mdash;the
  church was reprieved for a century. Its fall was delayed till the spirit
  in which it was attacked was winnowed clean of all doubtful
  elements&mdash;until Protestantism had recommenced its enterprise in a
  desire, not for a fairer adjustment of the world's good things, but in a
  desire for some deeper, truer, nobler, holier insight into the will of
  God. It recommenced not under the auspices of a Wycliffe, not with the
  partial countenance of a government which was crossing swords with the
  Father of Catholic Christendom, and menacing the severance of England
  from the unity of the faith, but under a strong dynasty of undoubted
  Catholic loyalty, with the entire administrative power, secular as well
  as spiritual, in the hands of the episcopate. It sprung up spontaneously,
  unguided, unexcited, by the vital necessity of its nature, among the
  masses of the nation.</p>

  <p>Leaping over a century, I pass to the year 1525, at which time, or
  about which time, a society was enrolled in London <!-- Page 311 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page311"></a>[pg 311]</span> calling itself "The
  Association of Christian Brothers."<a name="NtA_478"></a><a
  href="#Nt_478"><sup>478</sup></a> It was composed of poor men, chiefly
  tradesmen, artisans, a few, a very few of the clergy; but it was
  carefully organised, it was provided with moderate funds, which were
  regularly audited; and its paid agents went up and down the country
  carrying Testaments and tracts with them, and enrolling in the order all
  persons who dared to risk their lives in such a cause. The harvest had
  been long ripening. The records of the bishops' courts<a
  name="NtA_479"></a><a href="#Nt_479"><sup>479</sup></a> are filled from
  the beginning of the century with accounts of prosecutions for
  heresy&mdash;with prosecutions, that is, of men and women to whom the
  masses, the pilgrimages, the indulgences, the pardons, the effete
  paraphernalia of the establishment, had become intolerable; who had risen
  up in blind resistance, and had declared, with passionate anger, that
  whatever was the truth, all this was falsehood. The bishops had not been
  idle; they had plied their busy tasks with stake and prison, and victim
  after victim had been executed with more than necessary cruelty. But it
  was all in vain: punishment only multiplied offenders, and "the reek" of
  the martyrs, as was said when Patrick Hamilton was burnt at St. Andrews,
  "infected all that it did blow upon."<a name="NtA_480"></a><a
  href="#Nt_480"><sup>480</sup></a></p>

  <p>There were no teachers, however, there were no books, no unity of
  conviction, only a confused refusal to believe in lies. Copies of
  Wycliffe's Bible remained, which parties here and there, under death
  penalties if detected, met to read;<a name="NtA_481"></a><a
  href="#Nt_481"><sup>481</sup></a> copies, also, of some of his tracts<a
  name="NtA_482"></a><a href="#Nt_482"><sup>482</sup></a> were extant; but
  they were unprinted transcripts, most rare and precious, which the
  watchfulness of the police made it impossible to multiply through the
  press, and which remained therefore necessarily in the possession of but
  a few fortunate persons.</p>

  <p>The Protestants were thus isolated in single groups or <!-- Page 312
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span> families,
  without organisation, without knowledge of each other, with nothing to
  give them coherency as a party; and so they might have long continued,
  except for an impulse from some external circumstances. They were waiting
  for direction, and men in such a temper are seldom left to wait in
  vain.</p>

  <p>The state of England did but represent the state of all Northern
  Europe. Wherever the Teutonic language was spoken, wherever the Teutonic
  nature was in the people, there was the same weariness of unreality, the
  same craving for a higher life. England rather lagged behind than was a
  leader in the race of discontent. In Germany, all classes shared the
  common feeling; in England it was almost confined to the lowest. But,
  wherever it existed, it was a free, spontaneous growth in each separate
  breast, not propagated by agitation, but springing self sown, the
  expression of the honest anger of honest men at a system which had passed
  the limits of toleration, and which could be endured no longer. At such
  times the minds of men are like a train of gunpowder, the isolated grains
  of which have no relation to each other, and no effect on each other,
  while they remain unignited; but let a spark kindle but one of them, and
  they shoot into instant union in a common explosion. Such a spark was
  kindled in Germany, at Wittenberg, on the 31st of October, 1517. In the
  middle of that day Luther's denunciation of Indulgences was fixed against
  the gate of All Saints church, Wittenberg, and it became, like the brazen
  serpent in the wilderness, the sign to which the sick spirits throughout
  the western world looked hopefully and were healed. In all those millions
  of hearts the words of Luther found an echo, and flew from lip to lip,
  from ear to ear. The thing which all were longing for was done, and in
  two years from that day there was scarcely perhaps a village from the
  Irish Channel to the Danube in which the name of Luther was not familiar
  as a word of hope and promise. Then rose a common cry for guidance. Books
  were called for&mdash;above all things, the great book of all, the Bible.
  Luther's inexhaustible fecundity flowed with a steady stream, and the
  printing presses in Germany and in the Free Towns of the Netherlands,
  multiplied Testaments and tracts in hundreds of thousands. Printers
  published at their own expense as Luther wrote.<a name="NtA_483"></a><a
  href="#Nt_483"><sup>483</sup></a> The continent was covered with
  disfrocked monks who had become the pedlars of these precious wares;<a
  name="NtA_484"></a><a href="#Nt_484"><sup>484</sup></a> and as the
  contagion spread, noble young spirits from other countries, eager
  themselves <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page313"></a>[pg 313]</span> to fight in God's battle, came to
  Wittenberg to learn from the champion who had struck the first blow at
  their great enemy how to use their weapons. "Students from all nations
  came to Wittenberg," says one, "to hear Luther and Melancthon. As they
  came in sight of the town they returned thanks to God with clasped hands;
  for from Wittenberg, as heretofore from Jerusalem, proceeded the light of
  evangelical truth, to spread thence to the utmost parts of the earth."<a
  name="NtA_485"></a><a href="#Nt_485"><sup>485</sup></a> Thither came
  young Patrick Hamilton from Edinburgh, whose "reek" was of so much
  potency, a boy-enthusiast of nature as illustrious as his birth; and
  thither came also from England, which is here our chief concern, William
  Tyndal, a man whose history is lost in his work, and whose epitaph is the
  Reformation. Beginning life as a restless Oxford student, he moved thence
  to Cambridge, thence to Gloucestershire, to be tutor in a knight's
  family, and there hearing of Luther's doings, and expressing himself with
  too warm approval to suit his patron's conservatism,<a
  name="NtA_486"></a><a href="#Nt_486"><sup>486</sup></a> he fell into
  disgrace. From Gloucestershire he removed to London, where Cuthbert
  Tunstall had lately been made bishop, and from whom he looked for
  countenance in an intention to translate the New Testament. Tunstall
  showed little encouragement to this enterprise; but a better friend rose
  where he was least looked for; and a London alderman, Humfrey Monmouth by
  name, hearing the young dreamer preach on some occasion at St. Dunstan's,
  took him to his home for half a year, and kept him there: where "the said
  Tyndal," as the alderman declared, "lived like a good priest, studying
  both night and day; he would eat but sodden meat, by his good will, nor
  drink but small single beer; nor was he ever seen to wear linen about him
  all the time of his being there."<a name="NtA_487"></a><a
  href="#Nt_487"><sup>487</sup></a> The half year being passed, Monmouth
  gave him ten pounds, with which provision he went off to Wittenberg; and
  the alderman, for assisting him in that business, went to the
  Tower&mdash;escaping, however, we are glad to know, without worse
  consequences than a short imprisonment. Tyndal saw Luther,<a
  name="NtA_488"></a><a href="#Nt_488"><sup>488</sup></a> and under <!--
  Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span>
  his immediate direction translated the Gospels and Epistles while at
  Wittenberg. Thence he returned to Antwerp, and settling there under the
  privileges of the city, he was joined by Joy, who shared his great work
  with him. Young Frith from Cambridge came to him also, and Barnes, and
  Lambert, and many others of whom no written record remains, to concert a
  common scheme of action.</p>

  <p>In Antwerp, under the care of these men, was established the printing
  press, by which books were supplied, to accomplish for the teaching of
  England what Luther and Melancthon were accomplishing for Germany.
  Tyndal's Testament was first printed, then translations of the best
  German books, reprints of Wycliffe's tracts or original commentaries.
  Such volumes as the people most required were here multiplied as fast as
  the press could produce them; and for the dissemination of these precious
  writings, the brave London Protestants dared, at the hazard of their
  lives, to form themselves into an organised association.</p>

  <p>It is well to pause and look for a moment at this small band of
  heroes; for heroes they were, if ever men deserved the name. Unlike the
  first reformers who had followed Wycliffe, they had no earthly object,
  emphatically none; and equally unlike them, perhaps, because they had no
  earthly object, they were all, as I have said, poor men&mdash;either
  students, like Tyndal, or artisans and labourers who worked for their own
  bread, and in tough contact with reality, had learnt better than the
  great and the educated the difference between truth and lies. Wycliffe
  had royal dukes and noblemen for his supporters&mdash;knights and divines
  among his disciples&mdash;a king and a House of Commons looking upon him,
  not without favour. The first Protestants of the sixteenth century had
  for their king the champion of <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span> Holy Church, who had broken a lance
  with Luther; and spiritual rulers over them alike powerful and imbecile,
  whose highest conception of Christian virtue was the destruction of those
  who disobeyed their mandates. The masses of the people were indifferent
  to a cause which promised them no material advantage; and the Commons of
  Parliament, while contending with the abuses of the spiritual
  authorities, were laboriously anxious to wash their hands of heterodoxy.
  "In the crime of heresy, thanked be God," said the bishops in 1529,
  "there hath no notable person fallen in our time;" no chief priest, chief
  ruler, or learned Pharisee&mdash;not one. "Truth it is that certain
  apostate friars and monks, lewd priests, bankrupt merchants, vagabonds
  and lewd idle fellows of corrupt nature, have embraced the abominable and
  erroneous opinions lately sprung in Germany, and by them have been some
  seduced in simplicity and ignorance. Against these, if judgment have been
  exercised according to the laws of the realm, we be without blame. If we
  have been too remiss or slack, we shall gladly do our duty from
  henceforth."<a name="NtA_489"></a><a href="#Nt_489"><sup>489</sup></a>
  Such were the first Protestants in the eyes of their superiors. On one
  side was wealth, rank, dignity, the weight of authority, the majority of
  numbers, the prestige of centuries; here too were the phantom legions of
  superstition and cowardice; and here were all the worthier influences so
  pre-eminently English, which lead wise men to shrink from change, and to
  cling to things established, so long as one stone of them remains upon
  another, This was the army of conservatism. Opposed to it were a little
  band of enthusiasts, armed only with truth and fearlessness; "weak things
  of the world," about to do battle in God's name; and it was to be seen
  whether God or the world was the stronger. They were armed, I say, with
  the truth. It was that alone which could have given them victory in so
  unequal a struggle. They had returned to the essential fountain of life;
  they re-asserted the principle which has lain at the root of all
  religions, whatever their name or outward form, which once burnt with
  divine lustre in that Catholicism which was now to pass away; the
  fundamental axiom of all real life, that the service which man owes to
  God is not the service of words or magic forms, or ceremonies or
  opinions; but the service of holiness, of purity, of obedience to the
  everlasting laws of duty.</p>

  <p>When we look through the writings of Latimer, the apostle of the
  English Reformation, when we read the depositions <!-- Page 316 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>[pg 316]</span> against the
  martyrs, and the lists of their crimes against the established faith, we
  find no opposite schemes of doctrine, no "plans of salvation;" no
  positive system of theology which it was held a duty to believe; these
  things were of later growth, when it became again necessary to clothe the
  living spirit in a perishable body. We find only an effort to express
  again the old exhortation of the Wise Man&mdash;"Will you hear the
  beginning and the end of the whole matter? Fear God and keep his
  commandments; for that is the whole duty of man."</p>

  <p>Had it been possible for mankind to sustain themselves upon this
  single principle without disguising its simplicity, their history would
  have been painted in far other colours than those which have so long
  chequered its surface. This, however, has not been given to us; and
  perhaps it never will be given. As the soul is clothed in flesh, and only
  thus is able to perform its functions in this earth, where it is sent to
  live; as the thought must find a word before it can pass from mind to
  mind; so every great truth seeks some body, some outward form in which to
  exhibit its powers. It appears in the world, and men lay hold of it, and
  represent it to themselves, in histories, in forms of words, in
  sacramental symbols; and these things which in their proper nature are
  but illustrations, stiffen into essential fact, and become part of the
  reality. So arises in era after era an outward and mortal expression of
  the inward immortal life; and at once the old struggle begins to repeat
  itself between the flesh and the spirit, the form and the reality. For a
  while the lower tendencies are held in check; the meaning of the
  symbolism is remembered and fresh; it is a living language, pregnant and
  suggestive. Bye and bye, as the mind passes into other phases, the
  meaning is forgotten; the language becomes a dead language; and the
  living robe of life becomes a winding-sheet of corruption. The form is
  represented as everything, the spirit as nothing; obedience is dispensed
  with; sin and religion arrange a compromise; and outward observances, or
  technical inward emotions, are converted into jugglers' tricks, by which
  men are enabled to enjoy their pleasures and escape the penalties of
  wrong. Then such religion becomes no religion, but a falsehood; and
  honourable men turn away from it, and fall back in haste upon the naked
  elemental life.</p>

  <p>This, as I understand it, was the position of the early Protestants.
  They found the service of God buried in a system where obedience was
  dissipated into superstition; where sin <!-- Page 317 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>[pg 317]</span> was expiated by the
  vicarious virtues of other men; where, instead of leading a holy life,
  men were taught that their souls might be saved through masses said for
  them, at a money rate, by priests whose licentiousness disgraced the
  nation which endured it; a system in which, amidst all the trickery of
  the pardons, pilgrimages, indulgences,&mdash;double-faced as these
  inventions are&mdash;wearing one meaning in the apologies of theologians,
  and quite another to the multitude who live and suffer under their
  influence&mdash;one plain fact at least is visible. The people
  substantially learnt that all evils which could touch either their
  spirits or their bodies, might be escaped by means which resolved
  themselves, scarcely disguised, into the payment of moneys.</p>

  <p>The superstition had lingered long; the time had come when it was to
  pass away. Those in whom some craving lingered for a Christian life
  turned to the heart of the matter, to the book which told them who Christ
  was, and what he was; and finding there that holy example for which they
  longed, they flung aside in one noble burst of enthusiastic passion, the
  disguise which had concealed it from them. They believed in Christ, not
  in the bowing rood, or the pretended wood of the cross on which he
  suffered; and when that saintly figure had once been seen&mdash;the
  object of all love, the pattern of all imitation&mdash;thenceforward
  neither form nor ceremony should stand between them and their God.</p>

  <p>Under much confusion of words and thoughts, confusion pardonable in
  all men, and most of all in them, this seems to me to be transparently
  visible in the aim of these "Christian Brothers;" a thirst for some fresh
  and noble enunciation of the everlasting truth, the one essential thing
  for all men to know and believe. And therefore they were strong; and
  therefore they at last conquered. Yet if we think of it, no common daring
  was required in those who would stand out at such a time in defence of
  such a cause. The bishops might seize them on mere suspicion; and the
  evidence of the most abandoned villains sufficed for their conviction.<a
  name="NtA_490"></a><a href="#Nt_490"><sup>490</sup></a> By the act of
  Henry V., every officer, from the lord chancellor to the parish
  constable, was sworn to seek them out and destroy them; and both bishops
  and officials had shown no reluctance to execute their duty. Hunted like
  wild beasts from hiding-place to hiding-place, decimated by the stake,
  with the certainty that however many years they might be reprieved, their
  own lives would close at last <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span> in the same fiery trial; beset by
  informers, imprisoned, racked, and scourged; worst of all, haunted by
  their own infirmities, the flesh shrinking before the dread of a death of
  agony&mdash;thus it was that they struggled on; earning for
  <i>themselves</i> martyrdom&mdash;for <i>us</i>, the free England in
  which we live and breathe. Among the great, until Cromwell came to power,
  they had but one friend, and he but a doubtful one, who long believed the
  truest kindness was to kill them. Henry VIII. was always attracted
  towards the persons of the reformers. Their open bearing commanded his
  respect. Their worst crime in the bishops' eyes&mdash;the translating the
  Bible&mdash;was in his eyes not a crime, but a merit; he had himself long
  desired an authorised English version, and at length compelled the clergy
  to undertake it; while in the most notorious of the men themselves, in
  Tyndal and in Frith, he had more than once expressed an anxious
  interest.<a name="NtA_491"></a><a href="#Nt_491"><sup>491</sup></a> But
  the convictions of his early years were long in yielding. His feeling,
  though genuine, extended no further than to pity, to a desire to recover
  estimable heretics out of errors which he would endeavour to pardon. They
  knew, and all the "brethren" knew, that if they persisted, they must look
  for the worst from the king and from every earthly power; they knew it,
  and they made their account with it. An informer deposed to the council,
  that he had asked one of the society "how the King's Grace did take the
  matter against the sacrament; which answered, the King's Highness was
  extreme against their opinions, and would punish them grievously; also
  that my Lords of Norfolk and Suffolk, my Lord Marquis of Exeter, with
  divers other great lords, were very extreme against them. Then he (the
  informer) asked him how he and his fellows would do seeing this, the
  which answered they had two thousand books out against the Blessed
  Sacrament, in the commons' hands; and if it were once in the commons'
  heads, they would have no further care."<a name="NtA_492"></a><a
  href="#Nt_492"><sup>492</sup></a></p>

  <p>Tyndal then being at work at Antwerp, and the society for the
  dispersion of his books thus preparing itself in England, the authorities
  were not slow in taking the alarm. The isolated discontent which had
  prevailed hitherto had been left to the ordinary tribunals; the present
  danger called for measures of more systematic coercion. This duty
  naturally devolved on Wolsey, and the office of Grand Inquisitor, which
  he now assumed, could not have fallen into more competent hands.</p>

  <p>Wolsey was not cruel. There is no instance, I believe, in <!-- Page
  319 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>[pg 319]</span> which
  he of his special motion sent a victim to the stake;&mdash;it would be
  well if the same praise could be allowed to Cranmer. There was this
  difference between the cardinal and other bishops, that while they seemed
  to desire to punish, Wolsey was contented to silence; while they, in
  their conduct of trials, made escape as difficult as possible, Wolsey
  sought rather to make submission easy. He was too wise to suppose that he
  could cauterise heresy, while the causes of it, in the corruption of the
  clergy, remained unremoved; and the remedy to which he trusted, was the
  infusing new vigour into the constitution of the church.<a
  name="NtA_493"></a><a href="#Nt_493"><sup>493</sup></a> Nevertheless, he
  was determined to repress, as far as outward measures could repress it,
  the spread of the contagion; and he set himself to accomplish his task
  with the full energy of his nature, backed by the whole power, spiritual
  and secular, of the kingdom. The country was covered with his secret
  police, arresting suspected persons and searching for books. In London
  the scrutiny was so strict that at one time there was a general flight
  and panic; suspected butchers, tailors, and carpenters, hiding themselves
  in the holds of vessels in the river, and escaping across the Channel.<a
  name="NtA_494"></a><a href="#Nt_494"><sup>494</sup></a> Even there they
  were not safe. Heretics were outlawed by a common consent of the European
  governments. Special offenders were hunted through France by the English
  emissaries with the permission and countenance of the court,<a
  name="NtA_495"></a><a href="#Nt_495"><sup>495</sup></a> and there was an
  attempt to arrest Tyndal at Brussels, from which, for that time, he
  happily escaped.<a name="NtA_496"></a><a
  href="#Nt_496"><sup>496</sup></a></p>

  <p>Simultaneously the English universities fell under examination, in
  consequence of the appearance of dangerous symptoms among the younger
  students. Dr. Barnes, returning from the continent, had used violent
  language in a pulpit at Cambridge; and Latimer, then a neophyte in
  heresy, had grown suspect, and had alarmed the heads of houses.
  Complaints against both of them were forwarded to Wolsey, and they were
  summoned to London to answer for themselves.</p>

  <p>Latimer, for some cause, found favour with the cardinal, and was
  dismissed, with a hope on the part of his judge that his accusers might
  prove as honest as he appeared to be, and even <!-- Page 320 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page320"></a>[pg 320]</span> with a general
  licence to preach.<a name="NtA_497"></a><a
  href="#Nt_497"><sup>497</sup></a> Barnes was less fortunate; he was far
  inferior to Latimer; a noisy, unwise man, without reticence or prudence.
  In addition to his offences in matters of doctrine, he had attacked
  Wolsey himself with somewhat vulgar personality; and it was thought well
  to single him out for a public, though not a very terrible admonition.
  His house had been searched for books, which he was suspected, and justly
  suspected, of having brought with him from abroad. These, however,
  through a timely warning of the danger, had been happily secreted,<a
  name="NtA_498"></a><a href="#Nt_498"><sup>498</sup></a> or it might have
  gone harder with him. As it was, he was committed to the Fleet on the
  charge of having used heretical language. An abjuration was drawn up by
  Wolsey, which he signed; and while he remained in prison preparations
  were made for a ceremony, in which he was to bear a part, in St. Paul's
  church, by which the Catholic authorities hoped to produce some salutary
  effect on the disaffected spirits of London.</p>

  <p>Vast quantities of Tyndal's publications had been collected by the
  police. The bishops, also, had subscribed among themselves<a
  name="NtA_499"></a><a href="#Nt_499"><sup>499</sup></a> to buy up the
  copies of the New Testament before they <!-- Page 321 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page321"></a>[pg 321]</span> left
  Antwerp;&mdash;an unpromising method, like an attempt to extinguish fire
  by pouring oil upon it; they had been successful, however, in obtaining a
  large immediate harvest, and a pyramid of offending volumes was ready to
  be consumed in a solemn <i>auto da fé</i>.</p>

  <p>In the morning of Shrove Sunday, then, 1527, we are to picture to
  ourselves a procession moving along London streets from the Fleet prison
  to St. Paul's Cathedral. The warden of the Fleet was there, and the
  knight marshal, and the tipstaffs, and "all the company they could make,"
  "with bills and glaives;" and in the midst of these armed officials, six
  men marching in penitential dresses, one carrying a lighted taper five
  pounds' weight, the others with symbolic fagots, signifying to the
  lookers-on the fate which their crimes had earned for them, but which
  this time, in mercy, was remitted. One of these was Barnes; the other
  five were "Stillyard men," undistinguishable by any other name, but
  detected members of the brotherhood.</p>

  <p>It was eight o'clock when they arrived at St. Paul's. The people had
  flocked in crowds before them. The public seats and benches were filled.
  All London had hurried to the spectacle. A platform was erected in the
  centre of the nave, on the top of which, enthroned in pomp of purple and
  gold and splendour, sate the great cardinal, supported on each side with
  eighteen bishops, mitred abbots, and priors&mdash;six-and-thirty in all;
  his chaplains and "spiritual doctors" sitting also where they could find
  place, "in gowns of damask and satin." Opposite the platform, over the
  north door of the cathedral, was a great crucifix&mdash;a famous image,
  in those days called the Rood of Northen; and at the foot of it, inside a
  rail, a fire was burning, with the sinful books, the Tracts and
  Testaments, ranged round it in baskets, waiting for the execution of
  sentence.</p>

  <p>Such was the scene into the midst of which the six prisoners entered.
  A second platform stood in a conspicuous place in front of the cardinal's
  throne, where they could be seen and heard by the crowd; and there upon
  their knees, with their fagots on their shoulders, they begged pardon of
  God and the Holy Catholic Church for their high crimes and offences. When
  the confession was finished Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, preached <!--
  Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>[pg 322]</span> a
  sermon: and the sermon over, Barnes turned to the people, declaring that
  "he was more charitably handled than he deserved, his heresies were so
  heinous and detestable."</p>

  <p>There was no other religious service: mass had perhaps been said
  previous to the admission into the church of heretics lying under
  censure; and the knight marshal led the prisoners down from the stage to
  the fire underneath the crucifix. They were taken within the rails, and
  three times led round the blazing pile, casting in their fagots as they
  passed. The contents of the baskets were heaped upon the fagots, and the
  holocaust was complete. This time, an unbloody sacrifice was deemed
  sufficient. The church was satisfied with penance, and Fisher pronounced
  the prisoners absolved, and received back into communion.<a
  name="NtA_500"></a><a href="#Nt_500"><sup>500</sup></a></p>

  <p>So ended this strange exhibition, designed to work great results on
  the consciences of the spectators. It may be supposed, however, that men
  whom the tragedies of Smithfield failed to terrify, were not likely to be
  affected deeply by melodrame and blazing paper.</p>

  <p>A story follows of far deeper human interest, a story in which the
  persecution is mirrored with its true lights and shadows, unexaggerated
  by rhetoric; and which, in its minute simplicity, brings us face to face
  with that old world, where men like ourselves lived, and worked, and
  suffered, three centuries ago.</p>

  <p>Two years before the time at which we have now arrived, Wolsey, in
  pursuance of his scheme of converting the endowments of the religious
  houses to purposes of education, had obtained permission from the pope to
  suppress a number of the smaller monasteries. He had added largely to the
  means thus placed at his disposal from his own resources, and had founded
  the great college at Oxford, which is now called Christchurch.<a
  name="NtA_501"></a><a href="#Nt_501"><sup>501</sup></a> Desiring his
  magnificent institution to be as perfect as art could make it, he had
  sought his professors in Rome, in the Italian universities, wherever
  genius or ability could be found; and he had introduced into the
  foundation several students from Cambridge, who had been reported to him
  as being of unusual promise. Frith, of whom we have heard, was one of
  these. Of the rest, John Clark, Sumner, and Taverner are the most <!--
  Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"></a>[pg 323]</span>
  noticeable. At the time at which they were invited to Oxford, they were
  tainted, or some of them were tainted, in the eyes of the Cambridge
  authorities, with suspicion of heterodoxy;<a name="NtA_502"></a><a
  href="#Nt_502"><sup>502</sup></a> and it is creditable to Wolsey's
  liberality, that he set aside these unsubstantiated rumours, not allowing
  them to weigh against ability, industry, and character. The church
  authorities thought only of crushing what opposed them, especially of
  crushing talent, because talent was dangerous. Wolsey's noble anxiety was
  to court talent, and if possible to win it.</p>

  <p>The young Cambridge students, however, ill repaid his confidence (so,
  at least, it must have appeared to him), and introduced into Oxford the
  rising epidemic. Clark, as was at last discovered, was in the habit of
  reading St. Paul's Epistles to young men in his rooms; and a gradually
  increasing circle of undergraduates, of three or four years' standing,<a
  name="NtA_503"></a><a href="#Nt_503"><sup>503</sup></a> from various
  colleges, formed themselves into a spiritual freemasonry, some of them
  passionately insisting on being admitted to the lectures, in spite of
  warnings from Clark himself, whose wiser foresight knew the risk which
  they were running, and shrank from allowing weak giddy spirits to thrust
  themselves into so fearful peril.<a name="NtA_504"></a><a
  href="#Nt_504"><sup>504</sup></a></p>

  <p>This little party had been in the habit of meeting for about six
  months,<a name="NtA_505"></a><a href="#Nt_505"><sup>505</sup></a> when at
  Easter, 1527, Thomas Garret, a fellow of Magdalen,<a
  name="NtA_506"></a><a href="#Nt_506"><sup>506</sup></a> who had gone out
  of residence, and was curate at All Hallows church, in London,
  re-appeared in Oxford. Garret was a secret member of the London Society,
  and had come down at Clark's instigation, to feel his way in the
  university. So excellent a beginning had already been made, that he had
  only to improve upon it. He sought out all such young men as were given
  to Greek, Hebrew, and the polite Latin;<a name="NtA_507"></a><a
  href="#Nt_507"><sup>507</sup></a> and in this visit met with so much
  encouragement, that the Christmas following he returned again, this time
  bringing with him treasures of <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page324"></a>[pg 324]</span> forbidden books, imported by "the
  Christian Brothers;" New Testaments, tracts and volumes of German
  divinity, which he sold privately among the initiated.</p>

  <p>He lay concealed, with his store, at "the house of one Radley,"<a
  name="NtA_508"></a><a href="#Nt_508"><sup>508</sup></a> the position of
  which cannot now be identified; and there he remained for several weeks,
  unsuspected by the university authorities, till orders were sent by
  Wolsey to the Dean of Christchurch, for his arrest. Precise information
  was furnished at the same time respecting himself, his mission in Oxford,
  and his place of concealment.<a name="NtA_509"></a><a
  href="#Nt_509"><sup>509</sup></a></p>

  <p>The proctors were put upon the scent, and directed to take him; but
  one of them, Arthur Cole, of Magdalen, by name, not from any sympathy
  with Garret's objects, as the sequel proved, but probably from old
  acquaintance, for they were fellows at the same college, gave him
  information of his danger, and warned him to escape.</p>

  <p>His young friends, more alarmed for their companion than for
  themselves, held a meeting instantly to decide what should be done; and
  at this meeting was Anthony Dalaber, an undergraduate of Alban Hall, and
  one of Clark's pupils, who will now tell the story of what followed.</p>

  <p>"The Christmas before that time, I, Anthony Dalaber, the scholar of
  Alban Hall, who had books of Master Garret, had been in my country, at
  Dorsetshire, at Stalbridge, where I had a brother, parson of this parish,
  who was very desirous to have a curate out of Oxford, and willed me in
  any wise to get him one there, if I could. This just occasion offered, it
  was thought good among the brethren (for so we did not only call one
  another, but were indeed one to another), that Master Garret, changing
  his name, should be sent forth with my letters into Dorsetshire, to my
  brother, to serve him there for a time, until he might secretly convey
  himself from thence some whither over the sea. According hereunto I wrote
  my letters in all haste possible unto my brother, for Master Garret to be
  his curate; but not declaring what he was indeed, for my brother was a
  rank papist, and afterwards was the most mortal enemy that ever I had,
  for the Gospel's sake.</p>

  <p>"So on Wednesday (Feb. 18), in the morning before Shrovetide, Master
  Garret departed out of Oxford towards Dorsetshire, with my letter, for
  his new service."</p>

<!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>[pg 325]</span>

  <p>The most important person being thus, as was supposed, safe from
  immediate danger, Dalaber was at leisure to think a little about himself;
  and supposing, naturally, that the matter would not end there, and that
  some change of residence might be of advantage for his own security, he
  moved off from Alban Hall (as undergraduates it seems were then at
  liberty to do) to Gloucester College,<a name="NtA_510"></a><a
  href="#Nt_510"><sup>510</sup></a> under pretence that he desired to study
  civil law, for which no facilities existed at the hall. This little
  matter was affected on the Thursday; and all Friday and Saturday morning
  he "was so much busied in setting his poor stuff in order, his bed, his
  books, and such things else as he had," that he had no leisure to go
  forth anywhere those two days, Friday and Saturday.</p>

  <p>"Having set up my things handsomely," he continues, "the same day,
  before noon, I determined to spend that whole afternoon, until evensong
  time, at Frideswide College,<a name="NtA_511"></a><a
  href="#Nt_511"><sup>511</sup></a> at my book in mine own study; and so
  shut my chamber door unto me, and my study door also, and took into my
  head to read Francis Lambert upon the Gospel of St. Luke, which book only
  I had then within there. All my other books written on the Scriptures, of
  which I had great numbers, I had left in my chamber at Alban's Hall,
  where I had made a very secret place to keep them safe in, because it was
  so dangerous to have any such books. And so, as I was diligently reading
  in the same book of Lambert upon Luke, suddenly one knocked at my chamber
  door very hard, which made me astonished, and yet I sat still and would
  not speak; then he knocked again more hard, and yet I held my peace; and
  straightway he knocked again yet more fiercely; and then I thought this:
  peradventure it is somebody that hath need of me; and therefore I thought
  myself bound to do as I would be done unto; and so, laying my book aside,
  I came to the door and opened it, and there was Master Garret, as a man
  amazed, whom I thought to have been with my brother, and one with
  him."</p>

  <p>Garret had set out on his expedition into Dorsetshire, but had been
  frightened, and had stolen back into Oxford on the Friday, to his old
  hiding place, where, in the middle of the night, the proctors had taken
  him. He had been carried to Lincoln, and shut up in a room in the
  rector's house, where he had been <!-- Page 326 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>[pg 326]</span> left all day. In
  the afternoon the rector went to chapel, no one was stirring about the
  college, and he had taken advantage of the opportunity to slip the bolt
  of the door and escape. He had a friend at Gloucester College, "a monk
  who had bought books of him;" and Gloucester lying on the outskirts of
  the town, he had hurried down there as the readiest place of shelter. The
  monk was out; and as no time was to be lost, Garret asked the servant on
  the staircase to show him Dalaber's rooms.</p>

  <p>As soon as the door was opened, "he said he was undone, for he was
  taken." "Thus he spake unadvisedly in the presence of the young man, who
  at once slipped down the stairs," it was to be feared, on no good errand.
  "Then I said to him," Dalaber goes on, "alas, Master Garret, by this your
  uncircumspect coming here and speaking so before the young man, you have
  disclosed yourself and utterly undone me. I asked him why he was not in
  Dorsetshire. He said he had gone a day's journey and a half; but he was
  so fearful, his heart would none other but that he must needs return
  again unto Oxford. With deep sighs and plenty of tears, he prayed me to
  help to convey him away; and so he cast off his hood and gown wherein he
  came to me, and desired me to give him a coat with sleeves, if I had any;
  and he told me that he would go into Wales, and thence convey himself, if
  he might, into Germany. Then I put on him a sleeved coat of mine. He
  would also have had another manner of cap of me, but I had none but
  priestlike, such as his own was.</p>

  <p>"Then kneeled we both down together upon our knees, and lifting up our
  hearts and hands to God our heavenly Father, desired him, with plenty of
  tears, so to conduct and prosper him in his journey, that he might well
  escape the danger of all his enemies, to the glory of His Holy Name, if
  His good pleasure and will so were. And then we embraced and kissed the
  one the other, the tears so abundantly flowing out from both our eyes,
  that we all bewet both our faces, and scarcely for sorrow could we speak
  one to another. And so he departed from me, apparelled in my coat, being
  committed unto the tuition of our Almighty and merciful Father.</p>

  <p>"When he was gone down the stairs from my chamber, I straightways did
  shut my chamber door, and went into my study; and taking the New
  Testament in my hands, kneeled down on my knees, and with many a deep
  sigh and salt tear, I did, with much deliberation, read over the tenth
  chapter of <!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page327"></a>[pg 327]</span> St. Matthew's Gospel,<a
  name="NtA_512"></a><a href="#Nt_512"><sup>512</sup></a> praying that God
  would endue his tender and lately-born little flock in Oxford with
  heavenly strength by his Holy Spirit; that quietly to their own
  salvation, with all godly patience, they might bear Christ's heavy cross,
  which I now saw was presently to be laid on their young and weak backs,
  unable to bear so huge a burden without the greater help of his Holy
  Spirit.</p>

  <p>"This done, I laid aside my book safe, folded up Master Garret's gown
  and hood, and so, having put on my short gown, and shut my doors, I went
  towards Frideswide (Christchurch), to speak with that worthy martyr of
  God, Master Clark. But of purpose I went by St. Mary's church, to go
  first unto Corpus Christi College, to speak with Diet and Udal, my
  faithful brethren and fellows in the Lord. By chance I met by the way a
  brother of ours, one Master Eden, fellow of Magdalen, who, as soon as he
  saw me, said, we were all undone, for Master Garret was returned, and was
  in prison. I said it was not so; he said it was. I heard, quoth he, our
  Proctor, Master Cole, say and declare the same this day. Then I told him
  what was done; and so made haste to Frideswide, to find Master Clark, for
  I thought that he and others would be in great sorrow.</p>

  <p>"Evensong was begun; the dean and the canons were there in their grey
  amices; they were almost at Magnificat before I came thither. I stood in
  the choir door and heard Master Taverner play, and others of the chapel
  there sing, with and among whom I myself was wont to sing also; but now
  my <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328"></a>[pg
  328]</span> singing and music were turned into sighing and musing. As I
  there stood, in cometh Dr. Cottisford,<a name="NtA_513"></a><a
  href="#Nt_513"><sup>513</sup></a> the commissary, as fast as ever he
  could go, bareheaded, as pale as ashes (I knew his grief well enough);
  and to the dean he goeth into the choir, were he was sitting in his
  stall, and talked with him, very sorrowfully: what, I know not; but
  whereof I might and did truly guess. I went aside from the choir door to
  see and hear more. The commissary and dean came out of the choir,
  wonderfully troubled as it seemed. About the middle of the church, met
  them Dr. London,<a name="NtA_514"></a><a
  href="#Nt_514"><sup>514</sup></a> puffing, blustering, and blowing like a
  hungry and greedy lion seeking his prey. They talked together awhile; but
  the commissary was much blamed by them, insomuch that he wept for
  sorrow.</p>

  <p>"The doctors departed, and sent abroad their servants and spies
  everywhere. Master Clark, about the middle of the compline,<a
  name="NtA_515"></a><a href="#Nt_515"><sup>515</sup></a> came forth of the
  choir. I followed him to his chamber, and declared what had happened that
  afternoon of Master Garret's escape. Then he sent for one Master Sumner
  and Master Bets, fellows and canons there. In the meantime he gave me a
  very godly exhortation, praying God to give us all the wisdom of the
  serpent and the harmlessness of doves, for we should shortly have much
  need thereof. When Master Sumner and Master Bets came, he caused me to
  declare again the whole matter to them two. Then desiring them to tell
  our other brethren in that college, I went to Corpus Christi College, to
  comfort our brethren there, where I found in Diet's chamber, looking for
  me, Fitzjames, Diet, and Udal. They all knew the matter before by Master
  Eden, whom I had sent unto Fitzjames. So I tarried there and supped with
  them, where they had provided meat and drink for us before my coming; and
  when we had ended, Fitzjames would needs have me to lie that night with
  him in my old lodging at Alban's Hall. But small rest and little sleep
  took we both there that night."</p>

  <p>The next day, which was Sunday, Dalaber rose at five o'clock, and as
  soon as he could leave the Hall, hastened off to his rooms at Gloucester.
  The night had been wet and stormy, and his shoes and stockings were
  covered with mud. The college gates, when he reached them, were still
  closed, an unusual thing at that hour; and he walked up and down under
  the walls in the bleak grey morning, till the clock struck seven, "much
  disquieted, his head full of forecasting cares," but resolved, like a
  brave man, that <!-- Page 329 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page329"></a>[pg 329]</span> come what would, he would accuse no
  one, and declare nothing but what he saw was already known. The gates
  were at last opened; he went to his rooms, and for some time his key
  would not turn in the door, the lock having been meddled with. At length
  he succeeded in entering, and found everything in confusion, his bed
  tossed and tumbled, his study door open, and his clothes strewed about
  the floor. A monk who occupied the opposite rooms, hearing him return,
  came to him and said that the commissary and the two proctors had been
  there looking for Garret. Bills and swords had been thrust through the
  bed-straw, and every corner of the room searched for him. Finding
  nothing, they had left orders that Dalaber, as soon as he returned,
  should appear before the prior of the students.</p>

  <p>"This so troubled me," Dalaber says, "that I forgot to make clean my
  hose and shoes, and to shift me into another gown; and all bedirted as I
  was, I went to the said prior's chamber." The prior asked him where he
  had slept that night. At Alban's Hall, he answered, with his old
  bedfellow, Fitzjames. The prior said he did not believe him, and asked if
  Garret had been at his rooms the day before. He replied that he had.
  Whither had he gone, then? the prior inquired; and where was he at that
  time? "I answered," says Dalaber, "that I knew not, unless he was gone to
  Woodstock; he told me that he would go there, because one of the keepers
  had promised him a piece of venison to make merry with at Shrovetide.
  This tale I thought meetest, though it were nothing so."<a
  name="NtA_516"></a><a href="#Nt_516"><sup>516</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>[pg 330]</span>

  <p>At this moment the university beadle entered with two of the
  commissary's servants, bringing a message to the prior that he should
  repair at once to Lincoln, taking Dalaber with him. "I was brought into
  the chapel," the latter continues, "and there I found Dr. Cottisford,
  commissary; Dr. Higdon, Dean of Cardinal's College; and Dr. London,
  Warden of New College; standing together at the altar. They called for
  chairs and sate down, and then [ordered] me to come to them; they asked
  me what my name was, how long I had been at the university, what I
  studied," with various other inquiries: the clerk of the university,
  meanwhile, bringing pens, ink, and paper, and arranging a table with a
  few loose boards upon tressels. A mass book, he says, was then placed
  before him, and he was commanded to lay his hand upon it, and swear that
  he would answer truly such questions as should be asked him. At first he
  refused; but afterwards, being persuaded, "partly by fair words, and
  partly by great threats," he promised to do as they would have him; but
  in his heart he "meant nothing so to do." "So I laid my hand on the
  book," he goes on, "and one of them gave me my oath, and commanded me to
  kiss the book. They made great courtesy between them who should examine
  me; at last, the rankest Pharisee of them all took upon him to do it.</p>

  <p>"Then he asked me again, by my oath, where Master Garret was, and
  whither I had conveyed him. I said I had not conveyed him, nor yet wist
  where he was, nor whither he was gone, except he were gone to Woodstock,
  as I had before said. Surely, they said, I brought him some whither this
  morning, for they might well perceive by my foul shoes and dirty hosen
  that I had travelled with him the most part of the night. I answered
  plainly, that I lay at Alban's Hall with Sir Fitzjames, and that I had
  good witness thereof. They asked me where I was at evensong. I told them
  at Frideswide, and that I saw, first, Master Commissary, and then Master
  Doctor London, come thither to Master Dean. Doctor London and the Dean
  threatened me that if I would not tell the truth I should surely be sent
  to the Tower of London, and there be racked, and put into Little-ease.<a
  name="NtA_517"></a><a href="#Nt_517"><sup>517</sup></a></p>

  <p>"At last when they could get nothing out of me whereby to hurt or
  accuse any man, or to know anything of that which they sought, they all
  three together brought me up a long stairs, into a great chamber, over
  Master Commissary's chamber, wherein stood a great pair of very high
  stocks. Then Master Commissary <!-- Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page331"></a>[pg 331]</span> asked me for my purse and girdle, and
  took away my money and my knives; and then they put my legs into the
  stocks, and so locked me fast in them, in which I sate, my feet being
  almost as high as my head; and so they departed, locking fast the door,
  and leaving me alone.</p>

  <p>"When they were all gone, then came into my remembrance the worthy
  forewarning and godly declaration of that most constant martyr of God,
  Master John Clark, who, well nigh two years before that, when I did
  earnestly desire him to grant me to be his scholar, said unto me after
  this sort: 'Dalaber, you desire you wot not what, and that which you are,
  I fear, unable to take upon you; for though now my preaching be sweet and
  pleasant to you, because there is no persecution laid on you for it, yet
  the time will come, and that, peradventure, shortly, if ye continue to
  live godly therein, that God will lay on you the cross of persecution, to
  try you whether you can as pure gold abide the fire. You shall be called
  and judged a heretic; you shall be abhorred of the world; your own
  friends and kinsfolk will forsake you, and also hate you; you shall be
  cast into prison, and none shall dare to help you; you shall be accused
  before bishops, to your reproach and shame, to the great sorrow of all
  your friends and kinsfolk. Then will ye wish ye had never known this
  doctrine; then will ye curse Clark, and wish that ye had never known him
  because he hath brought you to all these troubles.'</p>

  <p>"At which words, I was so grieved that I fell down on my knees at his
  feet, and with tears and sighs besought him that, for the tender mercy of
  God, he would not refuse me; saying that I trusted, verily, that he which
  had begun this in me would not forsake me, but would give me grace to
  continue therein to the end. When he heard me say so, he came to me, took
  me in his arms and kissed me, the tears trickling from his eyes; and said
  unto me: 'The Lord God Almighty grant you so to do; and from henceforth
  for ever, take me for your father, and I will take you for my son in
  Christ.'"</p>

  <p>In these meditations the long Sunday morning wore away. A little
  before noon the commissary came again to see if his prisoner was more
  amenable; finding him, however, still obstinate, he offered him some
  dinner&mdash;a promise which we will hope he fulfilled, for here
  Dalaber's own narrative abruptly forsakes us,<a name="NtA_518"></a><a
  href="#Nt_518"><sup>518</sup></a> leaving uncompleted, at this point, the
  most vivid picture which remains to us of a fraction of English life in
  the <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>[pg
  332]</span> reign of Henry VIII. If the curtain fell finally on the
  little group of students, this narrative alone would furnish us with rare
  insight into the circumstances under which the Protestants fought their
  way. The story, however, can be carried something further, and the
  strangest incident connected with it remains to be told.</p>

  <p>Dalaber breaks off on Sunday at noon. The same day, or early the
  following morning, he was submitted once more to examination: this time,
  for the discovery of his own offences, and to induce him to give up his
  confederates. With respect to the latter he proved "marvellous
  obstinate." "All that was gotten of him was with much difficulty;" nor
  would he confess to any names as connected with heresy or heretics except
  that of Clark, which was already known. About himself he was more open.
  He wrote his "book of heresy," that is, his confession of faith, "with
  his own hand"&mdash;his evening's occupation, perhaps, in the stocks in
  the rector of Lincoln's house; and the next day he was transferred to
  prison.<a name="NtA_519"></a><a href="#Nt_519"><sup>519</sup></a></p>

  <p>This offender being thus disposed of, and strict secrecy being
  observed to prevent the spread of alarm, a rapid search was set on foot
  for books in all suspected quarters. The fear of the authorities was that
  "the infect persons would flee," and "convey" their poison "away with
  them."<a name="NtA_520"></a><a href="#Nt_520"><sup>520</sup></a> The
  officials, once on the scent of heresy, were skilful in running down the
  game. No time was lost, and by Monday evening many of "the brethren" had
  been arrested, their rooms examined, and their forbidden treasures
  discovered and rifled. Dalaber's store was found "hid with marvellous
  secresy;" and in one student's desk a duplicate of Garret's
  list&mdash;the titles of the volumes with which the first "Religious
  Tract Society" set themselves to convert England.</p>

  <p>Information of all this was conveyed in haste by Dr. London to the
  Bishop of Lincoln, as the ordinary of the university; and the warden told
  his story with much self-congratulation. On one point, however, the news
  which he had to communicate was less satisfactory. Garret himself was
  gone&mdash;utterly gone. Dalaber was obstinate, and no clue to the track
  of the fugitive could be discovered. The police were at fault; neither
  bribes nor threats could elicit anything; and in these desperate
  circumstances, as he told the bishop, the three heads of houses conceived
  that they might strain a point of propriety for so good a purpose as to
  prevent the escape of a heretic. Accordingly, <!-- Page 333 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page333"></a>[pg 333]</span> after a full report
  of the points of their success, Doctor London went on to relate the
  following remarkable proceeding:</p>

  <p>"After Master Garret escaped, <i>the commissary being in extreme
  pensiveness, knew no other remedy but this extraordinary, and caused a
  figure to be made by one expert in astronomy&mdash;and his judjment doth
  continually persist upon this, that he fled in a tawny coat
  south-eastward, and is in the middle of London, and will shortly to the
  sea side</i>. He was curate unto the parson of Honey Lane.<a
  name="NtA_521"></a><a href="#Nt_521"><sup>521</sup></a> It is likely he
  is privily cloaked there. Wherefore, as soon as I knew the judgment of
  this astronomer, I thought it expedient and my duty with all speed to
  ascertain your good lordship of all the premises; that in time your
  lordship may advertise my lord his Grace, and my lord of London. It will
  be a gracious deed that he and all his pestiferous works, which he
  carrieth about, might be taken, to the salvation of his soul, opening of
  many privy heresies, and extinction of the same."<a name="NtA_522"></a><a
  href="#Nt_522"><sup>522</sup></a></p>

  <p>We might much desire to know what the bishop's sensations were in
  reading this letter&mdash;to know whether it occurred to him that in this
  naïve acknowledgment, the Oxford heresy hunters were themselves
  confessing to an act of heresy; and that by the law of the church, which
  they were so eager to administer, they were liable to the same death
  which they were so zealous to secure for the poor vendors of Testaments.
  So indeed they really were. Consulting the stars had been ruled from
  immemorial time to be dealing with the devil; the penalty of it was the
  same as for witchcraft; yet here was a reverend warden of a college
  considering it his duty to write eagerly of a discovery obtained by these
  forbidden means, to his own diocesan, begging him to communicate with the
  Cardinal of York and the Bishop of London, that three of the highest
  church authorities in England might become <i>participes criminis</i>, by
  acting on this diabolical information.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the commissary, not wholly relying on the astrologer, but
  resolving prudently to make use of the more earthly resources which were
  at his disposal, had sent information of Garret's escape to the
  corporations of Dover, Rye, Winchester, Southampton, and Bristol, with
  descriptions of the person of the fugitive; and this step was taken with
  so much expedition, that before the end of the week no vessel was allowed
  to leave either of those harbours without being strictly searched.</p>

<!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334"></a>[pg 334]</span>

  <p>The natural method proved more effectual than the supernatural, though
  again with the assistance of a singular accident. Garret had not gone to
  London; unfortunately for himself, he had not gone to Wales as he had
  intended. He left Oxford, as we saw, the evening of Saturday, February
  21st. That night he reached a village called Corkthrop,<a
  name="NtA_523"></a><a href="#Nt_523"><sup>523</sup></a> where he lay
  concealed till Wednesday; and then, not in the astrologer's orange-tawny
  dress, but in "a courtier's coat and buttoned cap," which he had by some
  means contrived to procure, he set out again on his forlorn journey,
  making for the nearest sea-port, Bristol, where the police were looking
  out to receive him. His choice of Bristol was peculiarly unlucky. The
  "chapman" of the town was the step-father of Cole, the Oxford proctor: to
  this person, whose name was Master Wilkyns, the proctor had written a
  special letter, in addition to the commissary's circular; and the family
  connection acting as a spur to his natural activity, a coast guard had
  been set before Garret's arrival, to watch for him down the Avon banks,
  and along the Channel shore for fifteen miles. All the Friday night "the
  mayor, with the aldermen, and twenty of the council, had kept privy
  watch," and searched suspicious houses at Master Wilkyns's instance; the
  whole population were on the alert, and when the next afternoon, a week
  after his escape, the poor heretic, footsore and weary, dragged himself
  into the town, he found that he had walked into the lion's mouth.<a
  name="NtA_524"></a><a href="#Nt_524"><sup>524</sup></a> He quickly learnt
  this danger to which he was exposed, and hurried off again with the best
  speed which he could command; but it was too late. The chapman, alert and
  indefatigable, had heard that a stranger had been seen in the street; the
  police were set upon his track, and he was taken at Bedminster, a suburb
  on the opposite bank of the Avon, and hurried before a magistrate, where
  he at once acknowledged his identity.</p>

  <p>With such happy success were the good chapman's efforts rewarded. Yet
  in this world there is no light without shadow; no pleasure without its
  alloy. In imagination, Master Wilkyns had thought of himself conducting
  the prisoner in triumph into the streets of Oxford, the hero of the hour.
  The sour formality of the law condemned him to ill-merited
  disappointment. Garret had been taken beyond the liberties of the city;
  it was necessary, therefore, to commit him to the county gaol, and he
  <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>[pg
  335]</span> was sent to Ilchester. "Master Wilkyns offered himself to be
  bound to the said justice in three hundred pounds to discharge him of the
  said Garret, and to see him surely to Master Proctor's of Oxford; yet
  could he not have him, for the justice said that the order of the law
  would not so serve."<a name="NtA_525"></a><a
  href="#Nt_525"><sup>525</sup></a> The fortunate captor had therefore to
  content himself with the consciousness of his exploit, and the favourable
  report of his conduct which was sent to the bishops; and Garret went
  first to Ilchester, and thence was taken by special writ, and surrendered
  to Wolsey.</p>

  <p>Thus unkind had fortune shown herself to the chief criminal, guilty of
  the unpardonable offence of selling Testaments at Oxford, and therefore
  hunted down as a mad dog, and a common enemy of mankind. He escaped for
  the present the heaviest consequences, for Wolsey persuaded him to
  abjure. A few years later we shall again meet him, when he had recovered
  his better nature, and would not abjure, and died as a brave man should
  die. In the meantime we return to the university, where the authorities
  were busy trampling out the remains of the conflagration.</p>

  <p>Two days after his letter respecting the astrologer, the Warden of New
  College wrote again to the Diocesan, with an account of his further
  proceedings. He was an efficient inquisitor, and the secrets of the poor
  undergraduates had been unravelled to the last thread. Some of "the
  brethren" had confessed; all were in prison; and the doctor desired
  instructions as to what should be done with them. It must be said for Dr.
  London, that he was anxious that they should be treated leniently.
  Dalaber described him as a roaring lion, and he was a bad man, and came
  at last to a bad end. But it is pleasant to find that even he, a mere
  blustering arrogant official, was not wholly without redeeming points of
  character; and as little good will be said for him hereafter, the
  following passage in his second letter may be placed to the credit side
  of his account. The tone in which he wrote was at least humane, and must
  pass for more than an expression of natural kindness, when it is
  remembered that he was addressing a person with whom tenderness for
  heresy was a crime.</p>

  <p>"These youths," he said, "have not been long conversant with Master
  Garret, nor have greatly perused his mischievous books; and long before
  Master Garret was taken, divers of them were weary of these works, and
  delivered them to Dalaber. I am marvellous sorry for the young men. If
  they be openly <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page336"></a>[pg 336]</span> called upon, although they appear not
  greatly infect, yet they shall never avoid slander, because my Lord's
  Grace did send for Master Garret to be taken. I suppose his Grace will
  know of your good lordship everything. Nothing shall be hid, I assure
  your good lordship, an every one of them were my brother; and I do only
  make this moan for these youths, for surely they be of the most towardly
  young men in Oxford; and as far as I do yet perceive, not greatly infect,
  but much to blame for reading any part of these works."<a
  name="NtA_526"></a><a href="#Nt_526"><sup>526</sup></a></p>

  <p>Doctor London's intercession, if timid, was generous; he obviously
  wished to suggest that the matter should be hushed up, and that the
  offending parties should be dismissed with a reprimand. If the decision
  had rested with Wolsey, it is likely that this view would have been
  readily acted upon. But the Bishop of Lincoln was a person in whom the
  spirit of humanity had been long exorcised by the spirit of an
  ecclesiastic. He was staggering along the last years of a life against
  which his own register<a name="NtA_527"></a><a
  href="#Nt_527"><sup>527</sup></a> bears dreadful witness, and he would
  not burden his conscience with mercy to heretics. He would not mar the
  completeness of his barbarous career. He singled out three of the
  prisoners&mdash;Garret, Clark, and Ferrars<a name="NtA_528"></a><a
  href="#Nt_528"><sup>528</sup></a>&mdash;and especially entreated that
  they should be punished. "They be three perilous men," he wrote to
  Wolsey, "and have been the occasion of the corruption of youth. They have
  done much mischief, and for the love of God let them be handled
  thereafter."<a name="NtA_529"></a><a
  href="#Nt_529"><sup>529</sup></a></p>

  <p>Wolsey had Garret in his own keeping, and declined to surrender him.
  Ferrars had been taken at the Black Friars, in London,<a
  name="NtA_530"></a><a href="#Nt_530"><sup>530</sup></a> and making his
  submission, was respited and escaped with abjuration. But Clark was at
  Oxford, in the bishop's power, and the wicked old man was allowed to work
  his will upon him. A bill of heresy was drawn, which the prisoner was
  required to sign. He refused, and must have been sent to the stake, had
  he not escaped by dying prematurely of the treatment which he had
  received in prison.<a name="NtA_531"></a><a
  href="#Nt_531"><sup>531</sup></a> <!-- Page 337 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>[pg 337]</span> His last words only
  are recorded. He was refused the communion, not perhaps as a special act
  of cruelty, but because the laws of the church would not allow the holy
  thing to be profaned by the touch of a heretic. When he was told that it
  would not be suffered, he said "<i>crede et manducâsti</i>"&mdash;"faith
  is the communion;" and so passed away; a very noble person, so far as the
  surviving features of his character will let us judge; one who, if his
  manhood had fulfilled the promise of his youth, would have taken no
  common part in the Reformation.</p>

  <p>The remaining brethren were then dispersed. Some were sent home to
  their friends&mdash;others, Anthony Dalaber among them, were placed on
  their trial, and being terrified at their position, recanted, and were
  sentenced to do penance. Ferrars was brought to Oxford for the occasion,
  and we discern indistinctly (for the mere fact is all which survives) a
  great fire at Carfax; a crowd of spectators, and a procession of students
  marching up High Street with fagots on their shoulders, the solemn
  beadles leading them with gowns and maces. The ceremony was repeated to
  which Dr. Barnes had been submitted at St. Paul's. They were taken three
  times round the fire, throwing in each first their fagot, and then some
  one of the offending books, in token that they repented and renounced
  their errors.</p>

  <p>Thus was Oxford purged of heresy. The state of innocence which Dr.
  London pathetically lamented<a name="NtA_532"></a><a
  href="#Nt_532"><sup>532</sup></a> was restored, and the heads of houses
  had peace till their rest was broken by a ruder storm.</p>

  <p>In this single specimen we may see a complete image of Wolsey's
  persecution, as with varying details it was carried out in every town and
  village from the Tweed to the Land's End. I dwell on the stories of
  individual suffering, not to colour the narrative, or to re-awaken
  feelings of bitterness which may well rest now and sleep for ever; but
  because, through the years in which it was struggling for recognition,
  the history of Protestantism is the history of its martyrs. No rival
  theology, as I have said, had as yet shaped itself into formulas. We have
  not to trace any slow growing elaboration of opinion. Protestantism,
  before it became an establishment, was a refusal to live any longer in a
  lie. It was a falling back upon the undefined untheoretic rules of truth
  and piety which lay upon the surface of the Bible, and a determination
  rather to die than to mock with unreality any longer the Almighty Maker
  of the <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>[pg
  338]</span> world. We do not look in the dawning manifestations of such a
  spirit for subtleties of intellect. Intellect, as it ever does, followed
  in the wake of the higher virtues of manly honesty and truthfulness. And
  the evidences which were to effect the world's conversion were so
  cunningly arranged syllogistic demonstrations, but once more those
  loftier evidences which lay in the calm endurance by heroic men of the
  extremities of suffering, and which touched&mdash;not the mind with
  conviction, but the heart with admiring reverence.</p>

  <p>In the concluding years of his administration Wolsey was embarrassed
  with the divorce. Difficulties were gathering round him, from the failure
  of his hopes abroad and the wreck of his popularity at home; and the
  activity of the persecution was something relaxed, as the guiding mind of
  the great minister ceased to have leisure to attend to it. The bishops,
  however, continued, each in his own diocese, to act with such vigour as
  they possessed. Their courts were unceasingly occupied with vexatious
  suits, commenced without reason, and conducted without justice. They
  summoned arbitrarily as suspected offenders whoever had the misfortune to
  have provoked their dislike; either compelling them to criminate
  themselves by questions on the intricacies of theology,<a
  name="NtA_533"></a><a href="#Nt_533"><sup>533</sup></a> or allowing
  sentence to be passed against them on the evidence of abandoned persons,
  who would not have been admissible as witnesses before the secular
  tribunals.<a name="NtA_534"></a><a href="#Nt_534"><sup>534</sup></a></p>

  <p>It might have been thought that the clear perception which was shown
  by the House of Commons of the injustice with which the trials for heresy
  were conducted, the disregard, shameless and flagrant, of the provisions
  of the statutes under which the bishops were enabled to proceed, might
  have led them to reconsider the equity of persecution in itself; or, at
  least, to remove from the office of judges persons who had shown
  themselves so signally unfit to exercise that office. It would have been
  indecent, however, if not impossible, to transfer to a civil tribunal the
  cognisance of opinion; and, on the other hand, there was as yet among the
  upper classes of the laity no kind of disposition to be lenient towards
  those who were really unorthodox. The desire so far was only to check the
  reckless and random accusations of persons whose offence was to have <!--
  Page 339 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>[pg 339]</span>
  criticised, not the doctrine but the moral conduct, of the church
  authorities. The Protestants, although from the date of the meeting of
  the parliament and Wolsey's fall their ultimate triumph was certain,
  gained nothing in its immediate consequences. They suffered rather from
  the eagerness of the political reformers to clear themselves from
  complicity with heterodoxy; and the bishops were even taunted with the
  spiritual dissensions of the realm as an evidence of their indolence and
  misconduct.<a name="NtA_535"></a><a href="#Nt_535"><sup>535</sup></a>
  Language of this kind boded ill for the "Christian Brethren;" and the
  choice of Wolsey's successor for the office of chancellor soon confirmed
  their apprehensions; Wolsey had chastised them with whips; Sir Thomas
  More would chastise them with scorpions; and the philosopher of the
  <i>Utopia</i>, the friend of Erasmus, whose life was of blameless beauty,
  whose genius was cultivated to the highest attainable perfection, was to
  prove to the world that the spirit of persecution is no peculiar
  attribute of the pedant, the bigot, of the fanatic, but may co-exist with
  the fairest graces of the human character. The lives of remarkable men
  usually illustrate some emphatic truth. Sir Thomas More may be said to
  have lived to illustrate the necessary tendencies of Romanism in an
  honest mind convinced of its truth; to show that the test of sincerity in
  a man who professes to regard orthodoxy as an essential of salvation, is
  not the readiness to endure persecution, but the courage which will
  venture to inflict it.</p>

  <p>The seals were delivered to the new chancellor in November, 1529. By
  his oath on entering office he was bound to exert himself to the utmost
  for the suppression of heretics:<a name="NtA_536"></a><a
  href="#Nt_536"><sup>536</sup></a> he was bound, however, equally to obey
  the conditions under which the law allowed them to be suppressed.
  Unfortunately for his reputation as a judge, he permitted the hatred of
  "that kind of men," which he did not conceal that he felt,<a
  name="NtA_537"></a><a href="#Nt_537"><sup>537</sup></a> to obscure his
  conscience on this important feature of his duty, and tempt him to
  imitate the worst iniquities of the bishops. I do not intend in this
  place to relate the stories of his cruelties in his house at Chelsea,<a
  name="NtA_538"></a><a href="#Nt_538"><sup>538</sup></a> which he himself
  partially denied, and which at least we may hope were exaggerated. Being
  obliged to confine <!-- Page 340 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page340"></a>[pg 340]</span> myself to specific instances, I choose
  rather those on which the evidence is not open to question; and which
  prove against More, not the zealous execution of a cruel law, for which
  we may not fairly hold him responsible, but a disregard, in the highest
  degree censurable, of his obligations as a judge.</p>

  <p>The acts under which heretics were liable to punishment, were the 15th
  of the 2nd of Henry IV., and the 1st of the 2nd of Henry V.</p>

  <p>By the act of Henry IV., the bishops were bound to bring offenders to
  trial in open court, within three months of their arrest, if there were
  no lawful impediment. If conviction followed, they might imprison at
  their discretion. Except under these conditions, they were not at liberty
  to imprison.</p>

  <p>By the act of Henry V., a heretic, if he was first indicted before a
  secular judge, was to be delivered within ten days (or if possible, a
  shorter period) to the bishop, "to be acquit or convict" by a jury in the
  spiritual court, and to be dealt with accordingly.<a
  name="NtA_539"></a><a href="#Nt_539"><sup>539</sup></a></p>

  <p>The secular judge might detain a heretic for ten days before
  delivering him to the bishop. The bishop might detain him for three
  months before his trial. Neither the secular judge nor the bishop had
  power to inflict indefinite imprisonment at will while the trial was
  delayed; nor if on the trial the bishop failed in securing a conviction,
  was he at liberty to detain the accused person any longer on the same
  charge, because the result was not satisfactory to himself. These
  provisions were not preposterously lenient. Sir Thomas More should have
  found no difficulty in observing them himself, and in securing the
  observance of them by the bishops, at least in cases where he was himself
  responsible for the first committal. It is to be feared that he forgot
  that he was a judge in his eagerness to be a partisan, and permitted no
  punctilious legal scruples to interfere with the more important object of
  ensuring punishment to heretics.</p>

  <p>The first case which I shall mention is one in which the Bishop of
  London was principally guilty; not, however, without More's countenance,
  and, if Foxe is to be believed, his efficient support.</p>

  <p>In December, 1529, the month succeeding his appointment as chancellor,
  More, at the instance of the Bishop of London,<a name="NtA_540"></a><a
  href="#Nt_540"><sup>540</sup></a> arrested a citizen of London, Thomas
  Philips by name, on a charge of heresy.</p>

<!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341"></a>[pg 341]</span>

  <p>The prisoner was surrendered in due form to his diocesan, and was
  brought to trial on the 4th of February; a series of articles being
  alleged against him by Foxford, the bishop's vicar-general. The articles
  were of the usual kind. The prisoner was accused of having used
  unorthodox expressions on transubstantiation, on purgatory, pilgrimages,
  and confession. It does not appear whether any witnesses were produced.
  The vicar-general brought his accusations on the ground of general
  rumour, and failed to maintain them. Whether there were witnesses or not,
  neither the particular offences, nor even the fact of the general rumour,
  could be proved to the satisfaction of the jury. Philips himself
  encountered each separate charge with a specific denial, declaring that
  he neither was, nor ever had been, other than orthodox; and the result of
  the trial was, that no conviction could be obtained. The prisoner "was
  found so clear from all manner of infamous slanders and suspicions, that
  all the people before the said bishop, shouting in judgment as with one
  voice, openly witnessed his good name and fame, to the great reproof and
  shame of the said bishop, if he had not been ashamed to be ashamed."<a
  name="NtA_541"></a><a href="#Nt_541"><sup>541</sup></a> The case had
  broken down; the proceedings were over, and by law the accused person was
  free. But the law, except when it was on their own side, was of little
  importance to the church authorities. As they had failed to prove Philips
  guilty of heresy, they called upon him to confess his guilt by abjuring
  it; "as if," he says, "there were no difference between a nocent and an
  innocent, between a guilty and a not guilty."<a name="NtA_542"></a><a
  href="#Nt_542"><sup>542</sup></a></p>

  <p>He refused resolutely, and was remanded to prison, in open violation
  of the law. The bishop, in conjunction with Sir Thomas More,<a
  name="NtA_543"></a><a href="#Nt_543"><sup>543</sup></a> sent for him from
  time to time, submitting him to private examinations, which again were
  illegal; and urged the required confession, in order, as Philips says,
  "to save the bishop's credit."</p>

  <p>The further they advanced, the more difficult it was to recede; and
  the bishop at length, irritated at his failure, concluded the process
  with an arbitrary sentence of excommunication. From this sentence,
  whether just or unjust, there was then no appeal, except to the pope. The
  wretched man, in virtue of it, was no longer under the protection of the
  law, and was committed to the Tower, where he languished for three years,
  protesting, <!-- Page 342 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page342"></a>[pg 342]</span> but protesting fruitlessly, against
  the tyranny which had crushed him, and clamouring for justice in the deaf
  ears of pedants who knew not what justice meant.</p>

  <p>If this had occurred at the beginning of the century, the prisoner
  would have been left to die, as countless multitudes had already died,
  unheard, uncared for, unthought of; the victim not of deliberate cruelty,
  but of that frightfullest portent, folly armed with power. Happily the
  years of his imprisonment had been years of swift revolution. The House
  of Commons had become a tribunal where oppression would not any longer
  cry wholly unheard; Philips appealed to it for protection, and recovered
  his liberty.<a name="NtA_544"></a><a
  href="#Nt_544"><sup>544</sup></a></p>

  <p>The weight of guilt in this instance presses essentially on Stokesley;
  yet a portion of the blame must be borne also by the chancellor, who
  first placed Philips in Stokesley's hands; who took part in the illegal
  private examinations, and who could not have been ignorant of the
  prisoner's ultimate fate. If, however, it be thought unjust to charge a
  good man's memory with an offence in which his part was only secondary,
  the following iniquity was wholly and exclusively his own. I relate the

  More's successor.<a name="NtA_545"></a><a
  href="#Nt_545"><sup>545</sup></a></p>

  <p>"<i>To the Right Hon. the Lord Chancellor of England. (Sir T. Audeley)
  and other of the King's Council.</i></p>

  <p>"In most humble wise showeth unto your goodness your poor bedeman John
  Field, how that the next morrow upon twelfth day,<a name="NtA_546"></a><a
  href="#Nt_546"><sup>546</sup></a> in the twenty-first year of our
  sovereign lord the King's Highness, Sir Thomas More, Knight, then being
  Lord Chancellor of England, did send certain of his servants, and caused
  your said bedeman, with certain others, to be brought to his place at
  Chelsea, and there kept him (after what manner and fashion it were now
  long to tell), by the space of eighteen days;<a name="NtA_547"></a><a
  href="#Nt_547"><sup>547</sup></a> and then set him at liberty, binding
  him to appear before him again the eighth day following in the Star
  Chamber, which was Candlemas eve; at which day your said bedeman
  appeared, and was then sent to the Fleet, where he continued until Palm
  Sunday two years after [in violation of both the statutes], kept so close
  the first quarter that his keeper only might visit him; and always after
  closed up with those that were handled most straitly; often searched,
  sometimes even at midnight; besides snares and traps laid to take him in.
  Betwixt Michaelmas and Allhalloween tide next after his coming to prison
  there was taken from your bedeman a Greek vocabulary, price five
  shillings; Saint Cyprian's works, with a book of the same Sir Thomas
  More's making, named the <i>Supplication of Souls</i>. For what cause it
  was done he committeth to the judgment of God, that seeth the souls of
  all persons. The said Palm Sunday, which was also our Lady's day, towards
  night there came two officers of the Fleet, named George Porter and John
  Butler, and took your bedeman into a ward alone, and there, after long
  searching, found his purse hanging at his girdle; which they took, and
  shook out the money to the sum of ten shillings, which was sent him to
  buy such necessaries as he lacked, and delivered him again his purse,
  well and truly keeping the money to themselves, as they said for their
  fees; and forthwith carried him from the Fleet (where he lost such poor
  bedding as he then had, and could never since get it), and delivered him
  to the Marshalsea, under our gracious sovereign's commandment and Sir
  Thomas More's. When the Sunday before the Rogation <!-- Page 344 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>[pg 344]</span> week following,
  your bedeman fell sick; and the Whitsun Monday was carried out on four
  men's backs, and delivered to his friends to be recovered if it so
  pleased God. At which time the keeper took for your bedeman's fees other
  ten shillings, when four shillings should have sufficed if he had been
  delivered in good health.</p>

  <p>"Within three weeks it pleased God to set your bedeman on his feet, so
  that he might walk abroad. Whereof when Sir Thomas More heard (who went
  out of his chancellorship about the time your bedeman was carried out of
  prison), although he had neither word nor deed which he could ever truly
  lay to your bedeman's charge, yet made he such means by the Bishops of
  Winchester and London, as your bedeman heard say, to the Hon. Lord Thomas
  Duke of Norfolk, that he gave new commandment to the keeper of the
  Marshalsea to attach again your said bedeman; which thing was speedily
  done the Sunday three weeks after his deliverance. And so he continued in
  prison again until Saint Lawrence tide following; at which time money was
  given to the keeper, and some things he took which were not given, and
  then was your bedeman re-delivered through the king's goodness, under
  sureties bound in a certain sum, that he should appear the first day of
  the next term following, and then day by day until his dismission. And so
  hath your bedeman been at liberty now twelve months waiting daily from
  term to term, and nothing laid to his charge as before.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore, the premises tenderly considered, and also your said
  bedeman's great poverty, he most humbly beseecheth your goodness that he
  may now be clearly discharged; and if books, money, or other things seem
  to be taken or kept from him otherwise than justice would, eftsoons he
  beseecheth you that ye will command it to be restored.</p>

  <p>"As for his long imprisonment, with other griefs thereto appertaining,
  he looketh not to have recompense of man; but committeth his whole cause
  to God, to whom your bedeman shall daily pray, according as he is bound,
  that ye may so order and govern the realm that it may be to the honour of
  God and your heavenly and everlasting reward."</p>

  <p>I do not find the result of this petition, but as it appeared that
  Henry had interested himself in the story, it is likely to have been
  successful. We can form but an imperfect judgment on the merits of the
  case, for we have only the sufferer's <i>ex parte</i> complaint, and More
  might probably have been able to make some counter-statement. But the
  illegal imprisonment cannot <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page345"></a>[pg 345]</span> be explained away, and cannot be
  palliated; and when a judge permits himself to commit an act of arbitrary
  tyranny, we argue from the known to the unknown, and refuse reasonably to
  give him credit for equity where he was so little careful of law.</p>

  <p>Yet a few years of misery in a prison was but an insignificant
  misfortune when compared with the fate under which so many other poor men
  were at this time overwhelmed. Under Wolsey's chancellorship the stake
  had been comparatively idle; he possessed a remarkable power of making
  recantation easy; and there is, I believe, no instance in which an
  accused heretic was brought under his immediate cognisance, where he
  failed to arrange some terms by which submission was made possible. With
  Wolsey heresy was an error&mdash;with More it was a crime. Soon after the
  seals changed hands the Smithfield fires recommenced; and, the chancellor
  acting in concert with them, the bishops resolved to obliterate, in these
  edifying spectacles, the recollection of their general infirmities. The
  crime of the offenders varied&mdash;sometimes it was a denial of the
  corporal presence, more often it was a reflection too loud to be endured
  on the character and habits of the clergy; but whatever it was, the
  alternative lay only between abjuration humiliating as ingenuity could
  make it, or a dreadful death. The hearts of many failed them in the
  trial, and of all the confessors those perhaps do not deserve the least
  compassion whose weakness betrayed them, who sank and died
  broken-hearted. Of these silent sufferers history knows nothing. A few,
  unable to endure the misery of having, as they supposed, denied their
  Saviour, returned to the danger from which they had fled, and washed out
  their fall in martyrdom. Latimer has told us the story of his friend
  Bilney&mdash;little Bilney, or Saint Bilney,<a name="NtA_548"></a><a
  href="#Nt_548"><sup>548</sup></a> as he calls him, his companion at
  Cambridge, to whom he owed his own conversion. Bilney, after escaping
  through Wolsey's hands in 1527, was again cited in 1529 before the Bishop
  of London. Three times he refused to recant. He was offered a fourth and
  last chance. The temptation was too strong, and he fell. For two years he
  was hopelessly miserable; at length his braver nature prevailed. There
  was no pardon for a relapsed heretic, and if he was again in the bishop's
  hands he knew well the fate which awaited him.</p>

  <p>He told his friends, in language touchingly significant, that "he
  would go up to Jerusalem;" and began to preach in the <!-- Page 346
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>[pg 346]</span> fields.
  The journey which he had undertaken was not to be a long one. He was
  heard to say In a sermon, that of his personal knowledge certain things
  which had been offered in pilgrimage had been given to abandoned women.
  The priests, he affirmed, "take away the offerings, and hang them about
  their women's necks; and after that they take them off the women, if they
  please them not, and hang them again upon the images."<a
  name="NtA_549"></a><a href="#Nt_549"><sup>549</sup></a> This was Bilney's
  heresy, or formed the ground of his arrest; he was orthodox on the mass,
  and also on the power of the keys; but the secrets of the sacred order
  were not to be betrayed with impunity. He was seized, and hurried before
  the Bishop of Norwich; and being found heterodox on the papacy and the
  mediation of the saints by the Bishop of Norwich he was sent to the
  stake.</p>

  <p>Another instance of recovered courage, and of martyrdom consequent
  upon it, is that of James Bainham, a barrister of the Middle Temple. This
  story is noticeable from a very curious circumstance connected with
  it.</p>

  <p>Bainham had challenged suspicion by marrying the widow of Simon Fish,
  the author of the famous <i>Beggars' Petition</i>, who had died in 1528;
  and, soon after his marriage, was challenged to give an account of his
  faith. He was charged with denying transubstantiation, with questioning
  the value of the confessional, and the power of the keys; and the absence
  of authoritative Protestant dogma had left his mind free to expand to a
  yet larger belief. He had ventured to assert, that "if a Turk, a Jew, or
  a Saracen do trust in God and keep his law, he is a good Christian
  man,"<a name="NtA_550"></a><a href="#Nt_550"><sup>550</sup></a>&mdash;a
  conception of Christianity, a conception of Protestantism, which we but
  feebly dare to whisper even at the present day. The proceedings against
  him commenced with a demand that he should give up his books, and also
  the names of other barristers with whom he was suspected to have held
  intercourse. He refused; and in consequence his wife was imprisoned, and
  he himself was racked in the Tower by order of Sir Thomas More. Enfeebled
  by suffering, he was then brought before Stokesley, and terrified by the
  cold merciless eyes of his judge, he gave way, not about his friends, but
  about himself: he abjured, and was dismissed heartbroken. This was on the
  seventeenth of February. He was only able to endure his wretchedness for
  a month. At the end of it, he appeared at a secret meeting of the
  Christian Brothers, in "a <!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page347"></a>[pg 347]</span> warehouse in Bow Lane," where he asked
  forgiveness of God and all the world for what he had done; and then went
  out to take again upon his shoulders the heavy burden of the cross.</p>

  <p>The following Sunday, at the church of St. Augustine, he rose in his
  seat with the fatal English Testament in his hand, and "declared openly,
  before all the people, with weeping tears, that he had denied God,"
  praying them all to forgive him, and beware of his weakness; "for if I
  should not return to the truth," he said, "this Word of God would damn
  me, body and soul, at the day of judgment." And then he prayed "everybody
  rather to die than to do as he did, for he would not feel such a hell
  again as he did feel for all the world's good."<a name="NtA_551"></a><a
  href="#Nt_551"><sup>551</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of course but one event was to be looked for; he knew it, and himself
  wrote to the bishop, telling him what he had done. No mercy was possible:
  he looked for none, and he found none.</p>

  <p>Yet perhaps he found what the wise authorities thought to be some act
  of mercy. They could not grant him pardon in this world upon any terms;
  but they would not kill him till they had made an effort for his soul. He
  was taken to the Bishop of London's coal cellar at Fulham, the favourite
  episcopal penance chamber, where he was ironed and put in the stocks; and
  there was left for many days, in the chill March weather, to bethink
  himself. This failing to work conviction, he was carried to Sir Thomas
  More's house at Chelsea, where for two nights he was chained to a post
  and whipped; thence, again, he was taken back to Fulham for another week
  of torture; and finally to the Tower, for a further fortnight, again with
  ineffectual whippings.</p>

  <p>The demands of charity were thus satisfied. The pious bishop and the
  learned chancellor had exhausted their means of conversion; they had
  discharged their consciences; and the law was allowed to take its course.
  The prisoner was brought to trial on the 20th of April, as a relapsed
  heretic. Sentence followed; and on the last of the month the drama closed
  in the usual manner at Smithfield. Before the fire was lighted Bainham
  made a farewell address to the people, laying his death expressly to
  More, whom he called his accuser and his judge.<a name="NtA_552"></a><a
  href="#Nt_552"><sup>552</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is unfortunately impossible to learn the feelings with which these
  dreadful scenes were witnessed by the people. There are stories which
  show that, in some instances, familiarity had produced the usual effect;
  that the martyrdom of saints was at times of no more moment to an English
  crowd than the execution <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page348"></a>[pg 348]</span> of ordinary felons&mdash;that it was a
  mere spectacle to the idle, the hardened, and the curious. On the other
  hand, it is certain that the behaviour of the sufferers was the argument
  which at last converted the nation; and an effect which in the end was so
  powerful with the multitude, must have been visible long before in the
  braver and better natures. The increasing number of prosecutions in
  London shows, also, that the leaven was spreading. There were five
  executions in Smithfield between 1529 and 1533, besides those in the
  provinces. The prisons were crowded with offenders who had abjured and
  were undergoing sentence; and the list of those who were "troubled" in
  various ways is so extensive, as to leave no doubt of the sympathy which,
  in London at least, must have been felt by many, very many, of the
  spectators of the martyrs' deaths. We are left, in this important point,
  mainly to conjecture; and if we were better furnished with evidence, the
  language of ordinary narrative would fail to convey any real notion of
  perplexed and various emotions. We have glimpses, however, into the inner
  world of men, here and there of strange interest; and we must regret that
  they are so few.</p>

  <p>A poor boy at Cambridge, John Randall, of Christ's College, a relation
  of Foxe the martyrologist, destroyed himself in these years in religious
  desperation; he was found in his study hanging by his girdle, before an
  open Bible, with his dead arm and finger stretched pitifully towards a
  passage on predestination.<a name="NtA_553"></a><a
  href="#Nt_553"><sup>553</sup></a></p>

  <p>A story even more remarkable is connected with Bainham's execution.
  Among the lay officials present at the stake, was "one Pavier," town
  clerk of London. This Pavier was a Catholic fanatic, and as the flames
  were about to be kindled he burst out into violent and abusive language.
  The fire blazed up, and the dying sufferer, as the red flickering tongues
  licked the flesh from off his bones, turned to him and said, "May God
  forgive thee, and shew more mercy than thou, angry reviler, shewest to
  me." The scene was soon over; the town clerk went home. A week after, one
  morning when his wife had gone to mass, he sent all his servants out of
  his house on one pretext or another, a single girl only being left, and
  he withdrew to a garret at the top of the house, which he used as an
  oratory. A large crucifix was on the wall, and the girl having some
  question to ask, went to the room, and found him standing before it
  "bitterly weeping." He told her to take his sword, which was rusty, and
  clean it. She went away, and left him; when <!-- Page 349 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page349"></a>[pg 349]</span> she returned, a
  little time after, he was hanging from a beam, dead. He was a singular
  person. Edward Hall, the historian, knew him, and had heard him say, that
  "if the king put forth the New Testament in English, he would not live to
  bear it."<a name="NtA_554"></a><a href="#Nt_554"><sup>554</sup></a> And
  yet he could not bear to see a heretic die. What was it? Had the meaning
  of that awful figure hanging on the torturing cross suddenly revealed
  itself? Had some inner voice asked him whether, in the prayer for his
  persecutors with which Christ had parted out of life, there might be some
  affinity with words which had lately sounded in his own ears? God, into
  whose hands he threw himself, self-condemned in his wretchedness, only
  knows the agony of that hour. Let the secret rest where it lies, and let
  us be thankful for ourselves that we live in a changed world.</p>

  <p>Thus, however, the struggle went forward; a forlorn hope of saints led
  the way up the breach, and paved with their bodies a broad road into the
  new era; and the nation the meanwhile was unconsciously waiting till the
  works of the enemy were won, and they could walk safely in and take
  possession. While men like Bilney and Bainham were teaching with words
  and writings, there were stout English hearts labouring also on the
  practical side of the same conflict, instilling the same lessons, and
  meeting for themselves the same consequences. Speculative superstition
  was to be met with speculative denial. Practical idolatry required a
  rougher method of disenchantment.</p>

  <p>Every monastery, every parish church, had in those days its special
  relics, its special images, its special something, to attract the
  interest of the people. The reverence for the remains of noble and pious
  men, the dresses which they had worn, or the bodies in which their
  spirits had lived, was in itself a natural and pious emotion; but it had
  been petrified into a dogma; and like every other imaginative feeling
  which is submitted to that bad process, it had become a falsehood, a mere
  superstition, a substitute for piety, not a stimulus to it, and a
  perpetual occasion of fraud. The people brought offerings to the shrines
  where it was supposed that the relics were of greatest potency. The
  clergy, to secure the offerings, invented the relics, and invented the
  stories of the wonders which had been worked by them. The greatest
  exposure of these things took place at the visitation of the religious
  houses. In the meantime, Bishop Shaxton's unsavoury inventory of what
  passed under the name of relics in the diocese of Salisbury, will furnish
  an adequate <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page350"></a>[pg 350]</span> notion of these objects of popular
  veneration. There "be set forth and commended unto the ignorant people,"
  he said, "as I myself of certain which be already come to my hands, have
  perfect knowledge, stinking boots, mucky combes, ragged rochettes, rotten
  girdles, pyl'd purses, great bullocks' horns, locks of hair, and filthy
  rags, gobbetts of wood, under the name of parcels of the holy cross, and
  such pelfry beyond estimation."<a name="NtA_555"></a><a
  href="#Nt_555"><sup>555</sup></a> Besides matters of this kind, there
  were images of the Virgin or of the Saints; above all, roods or
  crucifixes, of especial potency, the virtues of which had begun to grow
  uncertain, however, to sceptical Protestants; and from doubt to denial,
  and from denial to passionate hatred, there were but a few brief steps.
  The most famous of the roods was that of Boxley in Kent, which used to
  smile and bow, or frown and shake its head, as its worshippers were
  generous or closehanded. The fortunes and misfortunes of this image I
  shall by and bye have to relate. There was another, however, at
  Dovercourt, in Suffolk, of scarcely inferior fame. This image was of such
  power that the door of the church in which it stood was open at all hours
  to all comers, and no human hand could close it. Dovercourt therefore
  became a place of great and lucrative pilgrimage, much resorted to by the
  neighbours on all occasions of difficulty.</p>

  <p>Now it happened that within the circuit of a few miles there lived
  four young men, to whom the virtues of the rood had become greatly
  questionable. If it could work miracles, it must be capable, so they
  thought, of protecting its own substance; and they agreed to apply a
  practical test which would determine the extent of its abilities.
  Accordingly (about the time of Bainham's first imprisonment), Robert King
  of Dedham, Robert Debenham of Eastbergholt, Nicholas Marsh of Dedham, and
  Robert Gardiner of Dedham, "their consciences being burdened to see the
  honour of Almighty God so blasphemed by such an idol," started off "on a
  wondrous goodly night" in February, with hard frost and a clear full
  moon, ten miles across the wolds, to the church.</p>

  <p>The door was open as the legend declared; but nothing daunted, they
  entered bravely, and lifting down the "idol" from its shrine, with its
  coat and shoes, and the store of tapers which were kept for the services,
  they carried it on their shoulders for a quarter of a mile from the place
  where it had stood, "without any resistance of the said idol." There
  setting it on the <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>[pg 351]</span> ground, they struck a light, fastened
  the tapers to the body, and with the help of them, sacrilegiously burnt
  the image down to a heap of ashes; the old dry wood "blazing so brimly,"
  that it lighted them a full mile on their way home.<a
  name="NtA_556"></a><a href="#Nt_556"><sup>556</sup></a></p>

  <p>For this night's performance, which, if the devil is the father of
  lies, was a stroke of honest work against him and his family, the world
  rewarded these men after the usual fashion. One of them, Robert Gardiner,
  escaped the search which was made, and disappeared till better times; the
  remaining three were swinging in chains six months later on the scene of
  their exploit. Their fate was perhaps inevitable. Men who dare to be the
  first in great movements are ever self-immolated victims. But I suppose
  that it was better for them to be bleaching on their gibbets, than
  crawling at the feet of a wooden rood, and believing it to be God.</p>

<hr />

  <p>These were the first Paladins of the Reformation; the knights who slew
  the dragons and the enchanters, and made the earth habitable for common
  flesh and blood. They were rarely, as we have said, men of great ability,
  still more rarely men of "wealth and station;" but men rather of clear
  senses and honest hearts. Tyndal was a remarkable person, and so Clark
  and Frith promised to become; but the two last were cut off before they
  had found scope to show themselves; and Tyndal remaining abroad, lay
  outside the battle which was being fought in England, doing noble work,
  indeed, and ending as the rest ended, with earning a martyr's crown; but
  taking no part in the actual struggle except with his pen. As yet but two
  men of the highest order of power were on the side of
  Protestantism&mdash;Latimer and Cromwell. Of them we have already said
  something; but the time was now fast coming when they were to step
  forward, pressed by circumstances which could no longer dispense with
  them, into scenes of far wider activity; and the present seems a fitting
  occasion to give some closer account of their history. When the breach
  with the pope was made irreparable, and the papal party at home had
  assumed an attitude of suspended insurrection, the fortunes of the
  Protestants entered into a new phase. The persecution ceased; and those
  who but lately were carrying fagots in the streets, or hiding for their
  lives, passed at once by a sudden alternation into the sunshine of
  political favour. The summer was but a brief one, followed soon by
  returning winter; but Cromwell and <!-- Page 352 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page352"></a>[pg 352]</span> Latimer had
  together caught the moment as it went by; and before it was over, a work
  had been done in England which, when it was accomplished once, was
  accomplished for ever. The conservative party recovered their power, and
  abused it as before; but the chains of the nation were broken, and no
  craft of kings or priests or statesmen could weld the magic links
  again.</p>

  <p>It is a pity that of two persons to whom England owes so deep a debt,
  we can piece together such scanty biographies. I must attempt, however,
  to give some outline of the little which is known.</p>

  <p>The father of Latimer was a solid English yeoman, of Thurcaston, in
  Leicestershire. "He had no lands of his own," but he rented a farm "of
  four pounds by the year," on which "he tilled so much as kept half a
  dozen men;" "he had walk for a hundred sheep, and meadow ground for
  thirty cows."<a name="NtA_557"></a><a href="#Nt_557"><sup>557</sup></a>
  The world prospered with him; he was able to save money for his son's
  education and his daughters' portions; but he was freehanded and
  hospitable; he kept open house for his poor neighbours; and he was a good
  citizen, too, for "he did find the king a harness with himself and his
  horse," ready to do battle for his country, if occasion called. His
  family were brought up "in godliness and the fear of the Lord;" and in
  all points the old Latimer seems to have been a worthy, sound, upright
  man, of the true English mettle.</p>

  <p>There were several children.<a name="NtA_558"></a><a
  href="#Nt_558"><sup>558</sup></a> The Reformer was born about 1490, some
  five years after the usurper Richard had been killed at Bosworth.
  Bosworth being no great distance from Thurcaston, Latimer the father is
  likely to have been present in the battle, on one side or the
  other&mdash;the right side in those times it was no easy matter to
  choose&mdash;but he became a good servant of the new government&mdash;and
  the little Hugh, when a boy of seven years old, helped to buckle<a
  name="NtA_559"></a><a href="#Nt_559"><sup>559</sup></a> on his armour for
  him, "when he went to Blackheath field."<a name="NtA_560"></a><a
  href="#Nt_560"><sup>560</sup></a> Being a soldier himself, the old
  gentleman was careful to give his sons, whatever else he gave them, a
  sound soldier's training. "He was diligent," says Latimer, "to teach me
  to shoot with the bow: he taught me how to draw, how to lay my body in
  the bow&mdash;not to draw with strength of arm, as other nations do, but
  with the strength <!-- Page 353 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page353"></a>[pg 353]</span> of the body. I had my bows bought me
  according to my age and strength; as I increased in these, my bows were
  made bigger and bigger."<a name="NtA_561"></a><a
  href="#Nt_561"><sup>561</sup></a> Under this education, and in the
  wholesome atmosphere of the farmhouse, the boy prospered well; and by and
  bye, showing signs of promise, he was sent to school. When he was
  fourteen, the promises so far having been fulfilled, his father
  transferred him to Cambridge.<a name="NtA_562"></a><a
  href="#Nt_562"><sup>562</sup></a></p>

  <p>He was soon known at the university as a sober, hard-working student.
  At nineteen, he was elected fellow of Clare Hall; at twenty, he took his
  degree, and became a student in divinity, when he accepted quietly, like
  a sensible man, the doctrines which he had been brought up to believe. At
  the time when Henry VIII. was writing against Luther, Latimer was
  fleshing his maiden sword in an attack upon Melancthon;<a
  name="NtA_563"></a><a href="#Nt_563"><sup>563</sup></a> and he remained,
  he said, till he was thirty, "in darkness and the shadow of death." About
  this time he became acquainted with Bilney, whom he calls "the instrument
  whereby God called him to knowledge." In Bilney, doubtless, he found a
  sound instructor; but a careful reader of his sermons will see traces of
  a teaching for which he was indebted to no human master. His deepest
  knowledge was that which stole upon him unconsciously through the
  experience of life and the world. His words are like the clear impression
  of a seal; the account and the result of observations, taken first hand,
  on the condition of the English men and women of his time, in all ranks
  and classes, from the palace to the prison. He shows large acquaintance
  with books; with the Bible, most of all; with patristic divinity and
  school divinity; and history, sacred and profane: but if this had been
  all, he would not have been the Latimer of the <!-- Page 354 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>[pg 354]</span> Reformation, and
  the Church of England would not, perhaps, have been here to-day. Like the
  physician, to whom a year of practical experience in a hospital teaches
  more than a life of closest study, Latimer learnt the mental disorders of
  his age in the age itself; and the secret of that art no other man,
  however good, however wise, could have taught him. He was not an echo,
  but a voice; and he drew his thoughts fresh from the fountain&mdash;from
  the facts of the era in which God had placed him.</p>

  <p>He became early famous as a preacher at Cambridge, from the first, "a
  seditious fellow," as a noble lord called him in later life, highly
  troublesome to unjust persons in authority. "None, except the
  stiff-necked and uncircumcised, ever went away from his preaching, it was
  said, without being affected with high detestation of sin, and moved to
  all godliness and virtue."<a name="NtA_564"></a><a
  href="#Nt_564"><sup>564</sup></a> And, in his audacious simplicity, he
  addressed himself always to his individual hearers, giving his words a
  personal application, and often addressing men by name. This habit
  brought him first into difficulty in 1525. He was preaching before the
  university, when the Bishop of Ely came into the church, being curious to
  hear him. He paused till the bishop was seated; and when he recommenced,
  he changed his subject, and drew an ideal picture of a prelate as a
  prelate ought to be; the features of which, though he did not say so,
  were strikingly unlike those of his auditor. The bishop complained to
  Wolsey, who sent for Latimer, and inquired what he had said. Latimer
  repeated the substance of his sermon; and other conversation then
  followed, which showed Wolsey very clearly the nature of the person with
  whom he was speaking. No eye saw more rapidly than the cardinal's the
  difference between a true man and an impostor; and he replied to the
  Bishop of Ely's accusations by granting the offender a licence to preach
  in any church in England. "If the Bishop of Ely cannot abide such
  doctrine as you have here repeated," he said, "you shall preach it to his
  beard, let him say what he will."<a name="NtA_565"></a><a
  href="#Nt_565"><sup>565</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus fortified, Latimer pursued his way, careless of the university
  authorities, and probably defiant of them. He was still orthodox in
  points of theoretic belief. His mind was practical rather than
  speculative, and he was slow in arriving at conclusions which had no
  immediate bearing upon action. <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page355"></a>[pg 355]</span> No charge could be fastened upon him,
  definitely criminal; and he was too strong to be crushed by that
  compendious tyranny which treated as an act of heresy the exposure of
  imposture or delinquency.</p>

  <p>On Wolsey's fall, however, he would have certainly been silenced: if
  he had fallen into the hands of Sir Thomas More, he would have perhaps
  been prematurely sacrificed. But, fortunately, he found a fresh protector
  in the king. Henry heard of him, sent for him, and, with instinctive
  recognition of his character, appointed him one of the royal chaplains.
  He now left Cambridge and removed to Windsor, but only to treat his royal
  patron as freely as he had treated the Cambridge doctors&mdash;not with
  any absence of respect, for he was most respectful, but with that highest
  respect which dares to speak unwelcome truth where the truth seems to be
  forgotten. He was made chaplain in 1530&mdash;during the new persecution,
  for which Henry was responsible by a more than tacit acquiescence.
  Latimer, with no authority but his own conscience, and the strong
  certainty that he was on God's side, threw himself between the spoilers
  and their prey, and wrote to the king, protesting against the injustice
  which was crushing the truest men in his dominions. The letter is too
  long to insert; the close of it may show how a poor priest could dare to
  address the imperious Henry VIII.:</p>

  <p>"I pray to God that your Grace may take heed of the worldly wisdom
  which is foolishness before God; that you may do that [which] God
  commandeth, and not that [which] seemeth good in your own sight, without
  the word of God; that your Grace may be found acceptable in his sight,
  and one of the members of his church; and according to the office that he
  hath called your Grace unto, you may be found a faithful minister of his
  gifts, and not a defender of his faith: for he will not have it defended
  by man or man's power, but by his word only, by the which he hath
  evermore defended it, and that by a way far above man's power or
  reason.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore, gracious king, remember yourself; have pity upon your
  soul; and think that the day is even at hand when you shall give account
  for your office, and of the blood that hath been shed by your sword. In
  which day, that your Grace may stand steadfastly, and not be ashamed, but
  be clear and ready in your reckoning, and have (as they say), your
  <i>quietus est</i> sealed with the blood of our Saviour Christ, which
  only serveth at that day, is my daily prayer to Him that suffered death
  for <!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>[pg
  356]</span> our sins, which also prayeth to his Father for grace for us
  continually; to whom be all honour and praise for ever. Amen. The Spirit
  of God preserve your Grace."<a name="NtA_566"></a><a
  href="#Nt_566"><sup>566</sup></a></p>

  <p>These words, which conclude an address of almost unexampled grandeur,
  are unfortunately of no interest to us, except as illustrating the
  character of the priest who wrote them, and the king to whom they were
  written. The hand of the persecutor was not stayed. The rack and the lash
  and the stake continued to claim their victims. So far it was labour in
  vain. But the letter remains, to speak for ever for the courage of
  Latimer; and to speak something, too, for a prince that could respect the
  nobleness of the poor yeoman's son, who dared in such a cause to write to
  him as a man to a man. To have written at all in such a strain was as
  brave a step as was ever deliberately ventured. Like most brave acts, it
  did not go unrewarded; for Henry remained ever after, however widely
  divided from him in opinion, his unshaken friend.</p>

  <p>In 1531, the king gave him the living of West Kingston, in Wiltshire,
  where for a time he now retired. Yet it was but a partial rest. He had a
  special licence as a preacher from Cambridge, which continued to him
  (with the king's express sanction)<a name="NtA_567"></a><a
  href="#Nt_567"><sup>567</sup></a> the powers which he had received from
  Wolsey. He might preach in any diocese to which he was invited; and the
  repose of a country parish could not be long allowed in such stormy times
  to Latimer. He had bad health, being troubled with headache, pleurisy,
  colic, stone; his bodily constitution meeting feebly the demands which he
  was forced to make upon it.<a name="NtA_568"></a><a
  href="#Nt_568"><sup>568</sup></a> But he struggled on, travelling up and
  down to London, to Kent, to Bristol, wherever opportunity called him;
  marked for destruction by the bishops, if he was betrayed into an
  imprudent word, and himself living in constant expectation of death.<a
  name="NtA_569"></a><a href="#Nt_569"><sup>569</sup></a></p>

  <p>At length the Bishop of London believed that Latimer was in his power.
  He had preached at St. Abb's, in the city, "at the request of a company
  of merchants,"<a name="NtA_570"></a><a href="#Nt_570"><sup>570</sup></a>
  in the beginning of the winter of 1531; and soon after his return to his
  living, he was informed that he was to be cited before Stokesley. His
  friends in the neighbourhood wrote to him, evidently in great alarm, <!--
  Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page357"></a>[pg 357]</span>
  and more anxious that he might clear himself, than expecting that he
  would be able to do so;<a name="NtA_571"></a><a
  href="#Nt_571"><sup>571</sup></a> he himself, indeed, had almost made up
  his mind that the end was coming.<a name="NtA_572"></a><a
  href="#Nt_572"><sup>572</sup></a></p>

  <p>The citation was delayed for a few weeks. It was issued at last, on
  the 10th of January, 1531-2,<a name="NtA_573"></a><a
  href="#Nt_573"><sup>573</sup></a> and was served by Sir Walter
  Hungerford, of Farley.<a name="NtA_574"></a><a
  href="#Nt_574"><sup>574</sup></a> The offences with which he was charged
  were certain "excesses and irregularities" not specially defined; and the
  practice of the bishops in such cases was not to confine the prosecution
  to the acts committed; but to draw up a series of articles, on which it
  was presumed that the orthodoxy of the accused person was open to
  suspicion, and to question him separately upon each. Latimer was first
  examined by Stokesley; subsequently at various times by the bishops
  collectively; and finally, when certain formulas had been submitted to
  him, which he refused to sign, his case was transferred to convocation.
  The convocation, as we know, were then in difficulty with their
  premunire; they had consoled themselves in their sorrow with burning the
  body of Tracy; and they would gladly have taken further comfort by
  burning Latimer.<a name="NtA_575"></a><a
  href="#Nt_575"><sup>575</sup></a> He was submitted to the closest
  cross-questionings, in the hope that he would commit himself. They felt
  that he was the most dangerous person to them in the kingdom, and they
  laboured with unusual patience to ensure his conviction.<a
  name="NtA_576"></a><a href="#Nt_576"><sup>576</sup></a> <!-- Page 358
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>[pg 358]</span> With a
  common person they would have rapidly succeeded. But Latimer was in no
  haste to be a martyr; he would be martyred patiently when the time was
  come for martyrdom; but he felt that no one ought "to consent to die," as
  long as he could honestly live;<a name="NtA_577"></a><a
  href="#Nt_577"><sup>577</sup></a> and he baffled the episcopal
  inquisitors with their own weapons. He has left a most curious account of
  one of his interviews with them.</p>

  <p>"I was once in examination," he says,<a name="NtA_578"></a><a
  href="#Nt_578"><sup>578</sup></a> "before five or six bishops, where I
  had much turmoiling. Every week, thrice, I came to examination, and many
  snares and traps were laid to get something. Now, God knoweth, I was
  ignorant of the law; but that God gave me answer and wisdom what I should
  speak. It was God indeed, for else I had never escaped them. At the last,
  I was brought forth to be examined into a chamber hanged with arras,
  where I was before wont to be examined, but now, at this time, the
  chamber was somewhat altered: for whereas before there was wont ever to
  be a fire in the chimney,<a name="NtA_579"></a><a
  href="#Nt_579"><sup>579</sup></a> now the fire was taken away, and an
  arras hanging hanged over the chimney; and the table stood near the
  chimney's end, so that I stood between the table and the chimney's end.
  There was among these bishops that examined me one with whom I had been
  very familiar, and took him for my great friend, an aged man, and he sate
  next the table end. Then, among all other questions, he put forth one, a
  very subtle and crafty one, and such one indeed as I could not think so
  great danger in. And when I would make answer, 'I pray you, Master
  Latimer,' said he, 'speak out; I am very thick of hearing, and here be
  many that sit far off.' I marvelled at this, that I was bidden to speak
  out, and began to misdeem, and gave an ear to the chimney; and, sir,
  there I heard a pen walking in the chimney, behind the cloth. They had
  appointed one there to write all mine answers; for they made sure work
  that I should not start from them: there was no starting from them: God
  was my good Lord, and gave me answer; I could never else have escaped it.
  The question was this: 'Master Latimer, do you not think, on your
  conscience, that you have been suspected of heresy?'&mdash;a subtle
  question&mdash;a very subtle question. There was no holding of peace
  would serve. To hold my peace had been to grant myself faulty. To answer
  was every way full of danger. But God, which hath always given rile
  answer, helped me, or else I could never have escaped it. <i>Ostendite
  mihi numisma</i> <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>[pg 359]</span> <i>censûs</i>. Shew me, said he, a
  penny of the tribute money. They laid snares to destroy him, but he
  overturneth them in their own traps."<a name="NtA_580"></a><a
  href="#Nt_580"><sup>580</sup></a></p>

  <p>The bishops, however, were not men who were nice in their adherence to
  the laws; and it would have gone ill with Latimer, notwithstanding his
  dialectic ability. He was excommunicated and imprisoned, and would soon
  have fallen into worse extremities; but at the last moment he appealed to
  the king, and the king, who knew his value, would not allow him to be
  sacrificed. He had refused to subscribe the articles proposed to him.<a
  name="NtA_581"></a><a href="#Nt_581"><sup>581</sup></a> Henry intimated
  to the convocation that it was not his pleasure that the matter should be
  pressed further; they were to content themselves with a general
  submission, which should be made to the archbishop, without exacting more
  special acknowledgments. This was the reward to Latimer for his noble
  letter. He was absolved, and returned to his parish, though snatched as a
  brand out of the fire.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the tide turned, and the Reformation entered into a new
  phase.</p>

  <p>Such is a brief sketch of the life of Hugh Latimer, to the time when
  it blended with the broad stream of English history. With respect to the
  other very great man whom the exigencies of the state called to power
  simultaneously with him, our information is far less satisfactory. Though
  our knowledge of Latimer's early story comes to us in fragments only, yet
  there are certain marks in it by which the outline can be determined with
  certainty. A cloud rests over the youth and early manhood of Thomas
  Cromwell, through which, only at intervals, we catch glimpses of
  authentic facts; and these few fragments of reality seem rather to belong
  to a romance than to the actual life of a man.</p>

  <p>Cromwell, the malleus monachorum, was of good English family,
  belonging to the Cromwells of Lincolnshire. One of these, probably a
  younger brother, moved up to London and conducted an ironfoundry, or
  other business of that description, at Putney. He married a lady of
  respectable connections, of whom we know only that she was sister of the
  wife of a gentleman in Derbyshire, but whose name does not appear.<a
  name="NtA_582"></a><a href="#Nt_582"><sup>582</sup></a> The old <!-- Page
  360 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>[pg 360]</span>
  Cromwell dying early, the widow was re-married to a cloth-merchant; and
  the child of the first husband, who made himself so great a name in
  English story, met with the reputed fortune of a stepson, and became a
  vagabond in the wide world. The chart of his course wholly fails us. One
  day in later life he shook by the hand an old bell-ringer at Sion House
  before a crowd of courtiers, and told them that "this man's father had
  given him many a dinner in his necessities." And a strange random account
  is given by Foxe of his having joined a party in an expedition to Rome to
  obtain a renewal from the pope of certain immunities and indulgences for
  the town of Boston; a story which derives some kind of credibility from
  its connection with Lincolnshire, but is full of incoherence and
  unlikelihood. Following still the popular legend, we find him in the
  autumn of 1515 a ragged stripling at the door of Frescobaldi's
  banking-house in Florence, begging for help. Frescobaldi had an
  establishment in London,<a name="NtA_583"></a><a
  href="#Nt_583"><sup>583</sup></a> with a large connection there; and
  seeing an English face, and seemingly an honest one, he asked the boy who
  and what he was. "I am, sir," quoth he, "of England, and my name is
  Thomas Cromwell; my father is a poor man, and by occupation a
  cloth-shearer; I am strayed from my country, and am now come into Italy
  with the camp of Frenchmen that were overthrown at Garigliano, where I
  was page to a footman, carrying after him his pike and burganet."
  Something in the boy's manner was said to have attracted the banker's
  interest; he took him into his house, and after keeping him there as long
  as he desired to stay, he gave him a horse and sixteen ducats to help him
  home to England.<a name="NtA_584"></a><a
  href="#Nt_584"><sup>584</sup></a> Foxe is the first English authority for
  the story; and Foxe took it from Bandello, the novelist; but it is
  confirmed by, or harmonises with, a sketch of Cromwell's early life in a
  letter of Chappuys, the imperial ambassador, to Chancellor Granvelle.
  "Master Cromwell," wrote Chappuys in 1535, "is the son of a poor
  blacksmith, who lived in a small village four miles from London, and is
  buried in a common grave in the parish churchyard. In his youth, for some
  offence, he was imprisoned, and had to leave the country. He went to
  Flanders, and thence to Rome and other places in Italy."<a
  name="NtA_585"></a><a href="#Nt_585"><sup>585</sup></a></p>

  <p>Returning to England, he married the daughter of a woollen-dealer,
  <!-- Page 361 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>[pg
  361]</span> and became a partner in the business, where he amassed or
  inherited a considerable fortune.<a name="NtA_586"></a><a
  href="#Nt_586"><sup>586</sup></a> Circumstances afterwards brought him,
  while still young, in contact with Wolsey, who discovered his merit, took
  him into service, and in 1525, employed him in the most important work of
  visiting and breaking up the small monasteries, which the pope had
  granted for the foundation of the new colleges. He was engaged with this
  business for two years, and was so efficient that he obtained an
  unpleasant notoriety, and complaints of his conduct found their way to
  the king. Nothing came of these complaints, however, and Cromwell
  remained with the cardinal till his fall.<a name="NtA_587"></a><a
  href="#Nt_587"><sup>587</sup></a></p>

  <p>It was then that the truly noble nature which was in him showed
  itself. He accompanied his master through his dreary confinement at
  Esher,<a name="NtA_588"></a><a href="#Nt_588"><sup>588</sup></a> doing
  all that man could do to soften the outward wretchedness of it; and at
  the meeting of parliament, in which he obtained a seat, he rendered him a
  still more gallant service. The Lords had passed a bill of impeachment
  against Wolsey, violent, vindictive, and malevolent. It was to be
  submitted to the Commons, and Cromwell prepared to attempt an opposition.
  Cavendish has left a most characteristic <!-- Page 362 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>[pg 362]</span> description of his
  leaving Esher at this trying time. A cheerless November evening was
  closing in with rain and storm. Wolsey was broken down with sorrow and
  sickness; and had been unusually tried by parting with his retinue, whom
  he had sent home, as unwilling to keep them attached any longer to his
  fallen fortunes. When they were all gone, "My lord," says Cavendish,
  "returned to his chamber, lamenting the departure of his servants, making
  his moan unto Master Cromwell, who comforted him the best he could, and
  desired my lord to give him leave to go to London, where he would either
  make or mar before he came again, which was always his common saying.
  Then after long communication with my lord in secret, he departed, and
  took his horse and rode to London; at whose departing I was by, whom he
  bade farewell, and said, ye shall hear shortly of me, and if I speed well
  I will not fail to be here again within these two days."<a
  name="NtA_589"></a><a href="#Nt_589"><sup>589</sup></a> He did speed
  well. "After two days he came again with a much pleasanter countenance,
  and meeting with me before he came to my lord, said unto me, that he had
  adventured to put in his foot where he trusted shortly to be better
  regarded or all were done." He had stopped the progress of the
  impeachment in the Lower House, and was answering the articles one by
  one. In the evening he rode down to Esher for instructions. In the
  morning he was again at his place in Parliament; and he conducted the
  defence so skilfully, that finally he threw out the bill, saved Wolsey,
  and himself "grew into such estimation in every man's opinion, for his
  honest behaviour in his master's cause, that he was esteemed the most
  faithfullest servant, [and] was of all men greatly commended."<a
  name="NtA_590"></a><a href="#Nt_590"><sup>590</sup></a></p>

  <p>Henry admired his chivalry, and perhaps his talent. The loss of Wolsey
  had left him without any very able man, unless we may consider Sir Thomas
  More such, upon his council, and he could not calculate on More for
  support in his anti-Roman policy; he was glad, therefore, to avail
  himself of the service of a man who had given so rare a proof of
  fidelity, and who had been trained by the ablest statesman of the age.<a
  name="NtA_591"></a><a href="#Nt_591"><sup>591</sup></a></p>

  <p>To Wolsey Cromwell could render no more service except as a friend,
  and his warm friend he remained to the last. He became the king's
  secretary, representing the government in <!-- Page 363 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>[pg 363]</span> the House of
  Commons, and was at once on the high road to power. I cannot call him
  ambitious; an ambitious man would scarcely have pursued so refined a
  policy, or have calculated on the admiration which he gained by adhering
  to a fallen minister. He did not seek greatness&mdash;greatness rather
  sought him as the man in England most fit to bear it. His business was to
  prepare the measures which were to be submitted to Parliament by the
  government. His influence, therefore, grew necessarily with the rapidity
  with which events were ripening; and when the conclusive step was taken,
  and the king was married, the virtual conduct of the Reformation passed
  into his hands. His Protestant tendencies were unknown as yet, perhaps,
  even to his own conscience; nor to the last could he arrive at any
  certain speculative convictions. He was drawn towards the Protestants as
  he rose into power by the integrity of his nature, which compelled him to
  trust only those who were honest like himself.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>WILL OF THOMAS CROMWELL&mdash;1529.</h3>

  <p>In the name of God, Amen. The 12th day of July, in the year of our
  Lord God MCCCCCXXIX., and in the 21st year of the reign of our Sovereign
  Lord, King Henry VIII., I, Thomas Cromwell, of London, Gentleman, being
  whole in body and in good and perfect memory, lauded be the Holy Trinity,
  make, ordain, and declare this my present testament, containing my last
  will, in manner as following:&mdash;First I bequeath my soul to the great
  God of heaven, my Maker, Creator, and Redeemer, beseeching the most
  glorious Virgin and blessed Lady Saint Mary the Virgin and Mother, with
  all the holy company of heaven, to be mediators and intercessors for me
  to the Holy Trinity, so that I may be able, when it shall please Almighty
  God to call me out of this miserable world and transitory life, to
  inherit the kingdom of heaven amongst the number of good Christian
  people; and whensoever I shall depart this present life I bequeath my
  body to be buried where it shall please God to ordain me to die, and to
  be ordered after the discretion of mine executors undernamed. And for my
  goods which our Lord hath lent me in this world, I will shall be ordered
  and disposed in manner and form as hereafter shall ensue. First I give
  and bequeath unto my son Gregory Cromwell six hundred threescore six
  pounds, thirteen shillings, and fourpence, of lawful money of England,
  with the which six hundred threescore six pounds, thirteen shillings, and
  fourpence, I will mine executors undernamed immediately or as soon as
  they conveniently may after my decease, shall purchase lands, tenements,
  and hereditaments to the clear yearly value of £33 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
  by the year above all charges and reprises to the use of my said son
  Gregory, for term of his life; and after the decease of the said Gregory
  to the heirs male of his body lawfully to be begotten, and for lack of
  heirs male of the body of the said Gregory, lawfully begotten, to the
  heirs general of his body lawfully begotten. And for lack of such heirs
  to the right heirs of me the said Thomas Cromwell, in fee. I will also
  that immediately and as soon as the said lands, tenements, and
  hereditaments shall be so purchased after my death as is aforesaid by
  mine executors, that the yearly profits thereof shall be wholly spent and
  employed in and about the education and finding honestly of my said son
  Gregory, in virtue, good learning, and manners, until such time as he
  shall come to the full age of 24 years. During which time I heartily
  desire and require my said executors to be good unto my said you Gregory,
  and to see he do lose no time, but to see him virtuously ordered and
  brought up according to my trust.</p>

  <p>Item. I give and bequeath to my said son Gregory, (when he shall come
  to his full age of 24 years), two hundred pounds of lawful English money
  to order them as our Lord shall give him grace and discretion, which £200
  I will shall be put in surety to the intent the same may come to his
  hands at his said age of 24 years. Item. I give and bequeath to my said
  son Gregory of such household stuff as God hath lent me, three of my best
  featherbeds with their bolsters; and, the best pair of blankets of
  fustian, my best coverlet of tapestry, and my quilt of yellow Turkey
  satin; one pair of my best sheets, four pillows of down, with four pair

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE LAST EFFORTS OF DIPLOMACY</h3>

  <p>I have now to resume the thread of the political history where it was
  dropped at the sentence of divorce pronounced by Cranmer, and the
  coronation of the new queen. The effect was about to be ascertained of
  these bold measures upon Europe; and of what their effect would be, only
  so much could be foretold with certainty, that the time for trifling was
  past, and the pope and Francis of France would be compelled to declare
  their true intentions. If these intentions were honest, the subordination
  of England to the papacy might be still preserved in a modified form. The
  papal jurisdiction was at end, but the spiritual supremacy of the Bishop
  of Rome, with a diminished but considerable revenue attached to it,
  remained unaffected; and it was for the pope to determine whether, by
  fulfilling at last his original engagements, he would preserve these
  remnants of his power and privileges, or boldly take up the gage,
  excommunicate his disobedient subjects, and attempt by force to bring
  them back to their allegiance.</p>

  <p>The news of what had been done did not take him wholly by surprise. It
  was known at Brussels at the end of April that the king had married. The
  queen regent<a name="NtA_595"></a><a href="#Nt_595"><sup>595</sup></a>
  spoke of it to the ambassador sternly and significantly, not concealing
  her expectation of the mortal resentment which would be felt by her
  brothers;<a name="NtA_596"></a><a href="#Nt_596"><sup>596</sup></a> and
  the information was forwarded with the least <!-- Page 370 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page370"></a>[pg 370]</span> possible delay to
  the cardinals of the imperial faction at Rome. The true purposes which
  underlay the contradiction of Clement's language are undiscoverable.
  Perhaps in the past winter he had been acting out a deep
  intrigue&mdash;perhaps he was drifting between rival currents, and
  yielded in any or all directions as the alternate pressure varied; yet
  whatever had been the meaning of his language, whether it was a scheme to
  deceive Henry, or was the expression only of weakness and good-nature
  desiring to avoid a quarrel to the latest moment, the decisive step which
  had been taken in the marriage, even though it was nominally undivulged,
  obliged him to choose his course and openly adhere to it. After the
  experience of the past, there could be no doubt what that course would
  be.</p>

  <p>On the 12th of May a citation was issued against the King of England,
  summoning him to appear by person or proxy at a stated day. It had been
  understood that no step of such a kind was to be taken before the meeting
  of the pope and Francis; Bennet, therefore, Henry's faithful secretary,
  hastily inquired the meaning of this measure. The pope told him that it
  could not be avoided, and the language which he used revealed to the
  English agent the inevitable future. The king, he said, had defied the
  inhibitory brief which had been lately issued, and had incurred
  excommunication; the imperialists insisted that he should be proceeded
  against for contempt, and that the excommunication should at once be
  pronounced. However great might be his own personal reluctance, it was
  not possible for him to remain passive; and if he declined to resort at
  once to the more extreme exercise of his power, the hesitation was merely
  until the emperor was prepared to enforce the censures of the church with
  the strong hand. It stood not "with his honour to execute such censures,"
  he said, "and the same not to be regarded."<a name="NtA_597"></a><a
  href="#Nt_597"><sup>597</sup></a> But there was no wish to spare Henry;
  and if Francis could be detached from his ally, and if the condition of
  the rest of Christendom became such as to favour the enterprise, <!--
  Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371"></a>[pg 371]</span>
  England might evidently look for the worst which the pope, with the
  Catholic powers, could execute. If the papal court was roused into so
  menacing a mood by the mere intimation of the secret marriage, it was
  easy to foresee what would ensue when the news arrived of the proceedings
  at Dunstable. Bennet entreated that the process should be delayed till
  the interview; but the pope answered coldly that he had done his best and
  could do no more; the imperialists were urgent, and he saw no reason to
  refuse their petition.<a name="NtA_598"></a><a
  href="#Nt_598"><sup>598</sup></a> This was Clement's usual language, but
  there was something peculiar in his manner. He had been often violent,
  but he had never shown resolution, and the English agents were perplexed.
  The mystery was soon explained. He had secured himself on the side of
  France; and Francis, who at Calais had told Henry that his negotiations
  with the see of Rome were solely for the interests of England, that for
  Henry's sake he was marrying his son into a family beneath him in rank,
  that Henry's divorce was to form the especial subject of his conference
  with the pope, had consented to allow these dangerous questions to sink
  into a secondary place, and had relinquished his intention, if he had
  ever seriously entertained it, of becoming an active party in the English
  quarrel.</p>

  <p>The long-talked-of interview was still delayed. First it was to have
  taken place in the winter, then in the spring; June was the date last
  fixed for it, and now Bennet had to inform the king that it would not
  take place before September; and that, from the terms of a communication
  which had just passed between the parties who were to meet, the subjects
  discussed at the conference would not be those which he had been led to
  expect. Francis, in answer to a question from the pope, had specified
  three things which he proposed particularly to "intreat." The first
  concerned the defence of Christendom against the Turks, the second
  concerned the general council, and the third concerned "the extinction of
  the Lutheran sect."<a name="NtA_599"></a><a
  href="#Nt_599"><sup>599</sup></a> These were the points which the Most
  Christian king was anxious to discuss with the pope. For the latter good
  object especially, "he would devise and treat for the provision of an
  army." In the King of England's cause, he trusted "some means might be
  <!-- Page 372 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>[pg
  372]</span> found whereby it might be compounded;"<a
  name="NtA_600"></a><a href="#Nt_600"><sup>600</sup></a> but if persuasion
  failed, there was no fear lest he should have recourse to any other
  method.</p>

  <p>It was this which had given back to the pope his courage. It was this
  which Bennet had now to report to Henry. The French alliance, it was too
  likely, would prove a broken reed, and pierce the hand that leant upon
  it.</p>

  <p>Henry knew the danger; but danger was not a very terrible thing either
  to him or to his people. If he had conquered his own reluctance to risk a
  schism in the church, he was not likely to yield to the fear of
  isolation; and if there was something to alarm in the aspect of affairs,
  there was also much to encourage. His parliament was united and resolute.
  His queen was pregnant. The Nun of Kent had assigned him but a month to
  live after his marriage; six months had passed, and he was alive and
  well; the supernatural powers had not declared against him; and while
  safe with respect to enmity from above, the earthly powers he could
  afford to defy. When he finally divorced Queen Catherine, he must have
  foreseen his present position at least as a possibility, and if not
  prepared for so swift an apostasy in Francis, and if not yet wholly
  believing it, we may satisfy ourselves he had never absolutely trusted a
  prince of metal so questionable.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Norfolk was waiting at the French court, with a
  magnificent embassy, to represent the English king at the interview. The
  arrival of the pope had been expected in May. It was now delayed till
  September; and if Clement came after all, it would be for objects in
  which England had but small concern. It was better for England that there
  should be no meeting at all, than a meeting to devise schemes for the
  massacre of Lutherans. Henry therefore wrote to the Duke, telling him
  generally what he had heard from Rome; he mentioned the three topics
  which he understood were to form the matter of discussion; but he
  skilfully affected to regard them as having originated with the
  imperialists, and not with the French king. In a long paper of
  instructions, in which earnestness and irony were strangely blended, he
  directed the ambassador to treat his good brother as if he were still
  exclusively devoted to the interests of England; and to urge upon him, on
  the ground of this fresh delay, that the interview should not take place
  at all.<a name="NtA_601"></a><a href="#Nt_601"><sup>601</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page373"></a>[pg 373]</span>

  <p>"Our pleasure is," he wrote, "that ye shall say&mdash;that we be not a
  little moved in our heart to see our good brother and us, being such
  princes of Christendom, to be so handled with the pope, so much to our
  dishonour, and to the pope's and the emperor's advancement; seeming to be
  at the pope's commandment to come or tarry as he or his cardinals shall
  appoint; and to depend upon his pleasure when to meet&mdash;that is to
  say, when he list or never. If our good brother and we were either
  suitors to make request, the obtaining whereof we did much set by, or had
  any particular matter of advantage to entreat with him, these proceedings
  might be the better tolerated; but our good brother having no particular
  matter of his own, and being ... that [no] more glory nor surety could
  happen to the emperour than to obtain the effect of the three articles
  moved by the pope and his cardinals, we think it not convenient to attend
  the pleasure of the pope, to go or to abyde. We could have been content
  to have received and taken at the pope's hand, jointly with our good
  brother, pleasure and friendship in our great cause; [but] on the other
  part, we cannot esteem the pope's part so high, as to have our good
  brother an attendant suitor therefore ... desiring him, therefore, in
  anywise to disappoint for his part the said interview; and if he have
  already granted thereto&mdash;upon some new good occasion, which he now
  undoubtedly hath&mdash;to depart from the same.</p>

  <p>"For we, ye may say, having the justness of our cause for us, with
  such an entire and whole consent of our nobility and commons of our realm
  and subjects, and being all matters passed, and in such terms as they now
  be, do not find such lack and want of that the pope might do, with us or
  against us, as we would for the obtaining thereof be contented to have a
  French king our so perfect a friend, to be not only a mediator but a
  suitor therein, and a suitor attendant to have audience upon liking and
  after the advice of such cardinals as repute it among pastymes to play
  and dally with kings and princes; whose honour, ye may say, is above all
  things, and more dear to us in the person of our good brother, than is
  any piece of our cause at the pope's hands. And therefore, if there be
  none other thing but our cause, and the other causes whereof we be
  advertised, our advice, counsel, special desire also and request is,
  [that our good brother shall] break off the interview, unless the pope
  will make suit to him; and [unless] our said good brother hath such
  causes of his own as may particularly tend to his own benefit, honour,
  and profit&mdash;wherein he shall do great <!-- Page 374 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page374"></a>[pg 374]</span> and singular
  pleasure unto us; <i>giving to understand to the pope, that me know
  ourselves and him both, and look to be esteemed accordingly.</i>"</p>

  <p>Should it appear that on receipt of this communication, Francis was
  still resolved to persevere, and that he had other objects in view to
  which Henry had not been made privy, the ambassadors were then to remind
  him of the remaining obligations into which he had entered; and to
  ascertain to what degree his assistance might be calculated upon, should
  the pope pronounce Henry deposed, and the emperor attempt to enforce the
  sentence.</p>

  <p>After forwarding these instructions, the king's next step was to
  anticipate the pope by an appeal which would neutralise his judgment
  should he venture upon it; and which offered a fresh opportunity of
  restoring the peace of Christendom, if there was true anxiety to preserve
  that peace. The hinge of the great question, in the form which at last it
  assumed, was the validity or invalidity of the dispensation by which
  Henry had married his brother's widow. Being a matter which touched the
  limit of the pope's power, the pope was himself unable to determine it in
  his own favour; and the only authority by which the law could be ruled,
  was a general council. In the preceding winter, the pope had volunteered
  to submit the question to this tribunal; but Henry believing that it was
  on the point of immediate solution in another way, had then declined, on
  the ground that it would cause a needless delay. He was already married,
  and he had hoped that sentence might be given in his favour in time to
  anticipate the publication of the ceremony. But he was perfectly
  satisfied that justice was on his side; and was equally confident of
  obtaining the verdict of Europe, if it could be fairly pronounced. Now,
  therefore, under the altered circumstances, he accepted the offered
  alternative. He anticipated with tolerable certainty the effect which
  would be produced at Rome, when the news should arrive there of the
  Dunstable divorce; and on the 29th of June, he appealed formally, in the
  presence of the Archbishop of York, from the pope's impending sentence,
  to the next general council.<a name="NtA_602"></a><a

  <p>Of this curious document the substance was as follows:&mdash;It
  commenced with a declaration that the king had no intention of acting
  otherwise than became a good Catholic prince; or of injuring the church
  or attacking the privileges conceded by God to the Holy See. If his words
  could be lawfully shown to have such a tendency he would revoke, emend,
  and correct them in a Catholic spirit.</p>

  <p>The general features of the case were then recapitulated. His marriage
  with his brother's wife had been pronounced illegal by the principal
  universities of Europe, by the clergy of the two provinces of the Church
  of England, by the most learned theologians and canonists, and finally,
  by the public judgment of the church.<a name="NtA_603"></a><a
  href="#Nt_603"><sup>603</sup></a> He therefore had felt himself free;
  and, "by the inspiration of the Host High, had lawfully married another
  woman." Furthermore, "for the common weal and tranquillity of the realm
  of England, and for the wholesome rule and government of the same, he had
  caused to be enacted certain statutes and ordinances, by authority of
  parliaments lawfully called for that purpose." "Now, however," he
  continued, "we fearing that his Holyness the Pope ... having in our said
  cause treated us far otherwise than either respect for our dignity and
  desert, or the duty of his own office required at his hands, and having
  done us many injuries which we now of design do suppress, but which
  hereafter we shall be ready, should circumstances so require, to divulge
  ... may now proceed to acts of further injustice, and heaping wrong on
  wrong, may pronounce the censures and other penalties of the spiritual
  sword against ourselves, our realm, and subjects, seeking thereby to
  deprive us of the use of the sacraments, and to cut us off, in the sight
  of the world, from the unity of the church, to the no slight hurt and
  injury of our realm and subjects:</p>

  <p>"Fearing these things, and desiring to preserve from detriment not
  only ourselves, our own dignity and estimation, but also our subjects,
  committed to us by Almighty God; to keep them in the unity of the
  Christian faith, and in the wonted participation in the sacraments; that,
  when in truth they be not cut off from the integrity of the church, nor
  can nor will be so cut off in any manner, they may not appear to be so
  cut off in the estimation of men; [desiring further] to check and hold
  back our people <!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page376"></a>[pg 376]</span> whom God has given to us, lest, in the
  event of such injury, they refuse utterly to obey any longer the Roman
  Pontiff, as a hard and cruel pastor: [for these causes] and believing,
  from reasons probable, conjectures likely, and words used to our injury
  by his Holiness the Pope, which in divers manners have been brought to
  our ears, that some weighty act may be committed by him or others to the
  prejudice of ourselves and of our realm;&mdash;We, therefore, in behalf
  of all and every of our subjects, and of all persons adhering to us in
  this our cause, do make our appeal to the next general council, which
  shall be lawfully held, in place convenient, with the consent of the
  Christian princes, and of such others as it may concern&mdash;not in
  contempt of the Holy See, but for defence of the truth of the Gospel, and
  for the other causes afore rehearsed. And we do trust in God that it
  shall not be interpreted as a thing ill done on our part, if preferring
  the salvation of our soul and the relief of our conscience to any mundane
  respects or favours, we have in this cause regarded more the Divine law
  than the laws of man, and have thought it rather meet to obey God than to
  obey man."<a name="NtA_604"></a><a href="#Nt_604"><sup>604</sup></a></p>

  <p>By the appeal and the causes which were assigned for it, Henry
  pre-occupied the ground of the conflict; he entrenched himself in the
  "debateable land" of legal uncertainty; and until his position had been
  pronounced untenable by the general voice of Christendom, any sentence
  which the pope could issue would have but a doubtful validity. It was,
  perhaps, but a slight advantage; and the niceties of technical fencing
  might soon resolve themselves into a question of mere strength; yet, in
  the opening of great conflicts, it is well, even when a resort to force
  is inevitable, to throw on the opposing party the responsibility of
  violence; and Henry had been led, either by a refinement of policy, or by
  the plain straightforwardness of his intentions, into a situation where
  he could expect without alarm the unrolling of the future.</p>

  <p>The character of that future was likely soon to be decided. The appeal
  was published on the 29th of June; and as the pope must have heard, by
  the middle of the month at latest, of the trial and judgment at
  Dunstable, a few days would bring an account of the manner in which he
  had received the intelligence. Prior to the arrival of the couriers,
  Bennet, with the assistance of Cardinal Tournon, had somewhat soothed
  down his exasperation. Francis, also, having heard that immediate process
  was threatened, had written earnestly to deprecate such a <!-- Page 377
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page377"></a>[pg 377]</span> measure;<a
  name="NtA_605"></a><a href="#Nt_605"><sup>605</sup></a> and though he
  took the interference "very displeasantly,"<a name="NtA_606"></a><a
  href="#Nt_606"><sup>606</sup></a> the pope could not afford to lose, by
  premature impatience; the fruit of all his labour and diplomacy, and had
  yielded so far as to promise that nothing of moment should be done. To
  this state of mind he had been brought one day in the second week of
  June. The morning after, Bennet found him "sore altered." The news of "my
  Lord of Canterbury's proceedings" had arrived the preceding night; and
  "his Holiness said that [such] doings were too sore for him to stand
  still at and do nothing."<a name="NtA_607"></a><a
  href="#Nt_607"><sup>607</sup></a> It was "against his duty towards God
  and the world to tolerate them." The imperialist cardinals, impatient
  before, clamoured that the evil had been caused by the dilatory timidity
  with which the case had been handled from the first.<a
  name="NtA_608"></a><a href="#Nt_608"><sup>608</sup></a> The consistory
  sate day after day with closed doors;<a name="NtA_609"></a><a
  href="#Nt_609"><sup>609</sup></a> and even such members of it as had
  before inclined to the English side, joined in the common indignation.
  "Some extreme process" was instantly looked for, and the English agents,
  in their daily interviews with the pope, were forced to listen to
  language which it was hard to bear with equanimity. Bennet's well-bred
  courtesy carried him successfully through the difficulty; his companion
  Bonner was not so fortunate. Bonner's tongue was insolent, and under bad
  control. He replied to menace by impertinence; and on one occasion was so
  exasperating, that Clement threatened to burn him alive, or boil him in a
  caldron of lead.<a name="NtA_610"></a><a
  href="#Nt_610"><sup>610</sup></a> When fairly roused, the old man was
  dangerous; and the future Bishop of London wrote to England in extremity
  of alarm. His letter has not been found, but the character of it may be
  perceived from the reassuring reply of the king. The agents, Henry said,
  were not to allow themselves to be frightened; they were to go on calmly,
  with their accustomed diligence and dexterity, disputing the ground from
  point to point, and trust to him. Their cause was good, and, with God's
  help, he would be able to defend them from the malice of their
  adversaries.<a name="NtA_611"></a><a
  href="#Nt_611"><sup>611</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 378 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>[pg 378]</span>

  <p>Fortunately for Bonner, the pope's passion was of brief duration, and
  the experiment whether Henry's arm could reach to the dungeons of the
  Vatican remained untried. The more moderate of the cardinals, also,
  something assuaged the storm; and angry as they all were, the majority
  still saw the necessity of prudence. In the heat of the irritation, final
  sentence was to have been pronounced upon the entire cause, backed by
  interdict, excommunication, and the full volume of the papal thunders. At
  the close of a month's deliberation they resolved to reserve judgement on
  the original question, and to confine themselves for the present to
  revenging the insult to the pope by "my Lord of Canterbury." Both the
  king and the archbishop had disobeyed a formal inhibition. On the 12th of
  July, the pope issued a brief, declaring Cranmer's judgment to have been
  illegal, the English process to have been null and void, and the king, by
  his disobedience, to have incurred, <i>ipso facto</i>, the threatened
  penalties of excommunication. Of his clemency he suspended these censures
  till the close of the following September, in order that time might be
  allowed to restore the respective parties to their old positions: if
  within that period the parties were not so restored, the censures would
  fall.<a name="NtA_612"></a><a href="#Nt_612"><sup>612</sup></a> This
  brief was sent into Flanders, and fixed in the usual place against the
  door of a church in Dunkirk.</p>

  <p>Henry was prepared for a measure which was no more than natural. He
  had been prepared for it as a possibility when he married. Both he and
  Francis must have been prepared for it on their meeting at Calais, when
  the French king advised him to marry, and promised to support him through
  the consequences. His own measures had been arranged beforehand, and he
  had secured himself in technical entrenchments by his appeal. After the
  issue of the brief, however, he could allow no English embassy to
  compliment Clement by its presence on his visit to France. He "knew the
  pope," as he said. Long experience had shown him that nothing was to be
  gained by yielding in minor points; and the only chance which now
  remained of <!-- Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page379"></a>[pg 379]</span> preserving the established order of
  Christendom, was to terrify the Vatican court into submission by the
  firmness of his attitude. For the present complications, the court of
  Rome, not he, was responsible. The pope, with a culpable complacency for
  the emperor, had shrunk from discharging a duty which his office imposed
  upon him; and the result had been, that the duty was discharged by
  another. Henry could not blame himself for the consequences of Clement's
  delinquency. He rather felt himself wronged in having been driven to so
  extreme a measure against his will. He resolved, therefore, to recall the
  embassy, and once more, though with no great hope that he would be
  successful, to invite Francis to fulfil his promise, and to unite with
  himself in expressing his resentment at the pope's conduct.</p>

  <p>His despatch to the Duke of Norfolk on this occasion was the natural
  sequel of what he had written a few weeks previously. That letter had
  failed wholly of its effect. The interview was resolved upon for quite
  other reasons than those which were acknowledged, and therefore was not
  to be given up. A promise, however, had been extracted, that it should be
  given up, if in the course of the summer the pope "innovated anything"
  against the King of England; and Henry now required, formally, that this
  engagement should be observed. "A notorious and notable innovation" had
  been made, and Francis must either deny his words, or adhere to them. It
  would be evident to all the world, if the interview took place under the
  present circumstances, that the alliance with England was no longer of
  the importance with him which it had been; that his place in the
  struggle, when the struggle came, would be found on the papal side.</p>

  <p>The language of Henry throughout this paper was very fine and noble.
  He reminded Francis that substantially the cause at issue was the cause
  of all princes; the pope claiming a right to summon them to plead in the
  courts of Rome, and refusing to admit their exemption as sovereign
  rulers. He had been required not only to undo his marriage, and cancel
  the sentence of divorce, but, as a condition of reconciliation with the
  Holy See, to undo also, the Act of Appeals, and to restore the papal
  jurisdiction. He desired it to be understood, with emphasis, that these
  points were all equally sacred, and the repeal of the act was as little
  to be thought of as the annulling the marriage. "The pope," he said, "did
  inforce us to excogitate some new thing, whereby we might be healed and
  relieved of that continual disease, to care for our cause at Rome, where
  such defence <!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page380"></a>[pg 380]</span> was taken from us, as by the laws of
  God, nature, and man, is due unto us. Hereupon depended the wealth of our
  realm; hereupon consisted the surety of our succession, which by no other
  means could be well assured." "And therefore," he went on, "you [the
  Duke] shall say to our good brother, that the pope persisting in the ways
  he hath entered, ye must needs despair in any meeting between the French
  king and the pope, to produce any such effect as to cause us to meet in
  concord with the pope; but we shall be even as far asunder as is between
  yea and nay. For to the pope's enterprise to revoke or put back anything
  that is done here, either in marriage, statute, sentence, or
  proclamation<a name="NtA_613"></a><a
  href="#Nt_613"><sup>613</sup></a>&mdash;of which four members is knit and
  conjoined the surety of our matter, nor any can be removed from the
  other, lest thereby the whole edifice should be destroyed&mdash;we will
  and shall, by all ways and means say nay, and declare our nay in such
  sort as the world shall hear, and the pope feel it. Wherein ye may say
  our firm trust, perfect hope, and assured confidence is, that our good
  brother will agree with us; as well for that it should be partly
  dishonourable for him to see decay the thing that was of his own
  foundation and planting: as also that it should be too much dishonourable
  for us&mdash;having travelled so far in this matter, and brought it to
  this point, that all the storms of the year passed, it is now come to
  harvest, trusting to see shortly the fruit of our marriage, to the
  wealth, joy, and comfort of all our realm, and our own singular
  consolation&mdash;that anything should now be done by us to impair the
  same, and to put our issue either in peril of bastardy, or otherwise
  disturb that [which] is by the whole agreement of our realm established
  for their and our commodity, wealth, and benefit. And in this
  determination ye know us to be so fixed, and the contrary hereof to be so
  infeasible, either at our hands, or by the consent of the realm, that ye
  must needs despair of any order to be taken by the French king with the
  pope. For if any were by him taken wherein any of these four pieces
  should be touched&mdash;that is to say, the marriage of the queen our
  wife, the revocation of the Bishop of Canterbury's sentence, the statute
  of our realm, or our late proclamation, which be as it were one&mdash;and
  as walls, covering, the foundation make a house, so they knit together,
  establish, and make one matter&mdash;ye be well assured, and be so
  ascertained from us, that in no wise we will relent, but will, as we have
  before written, withstand the same. Whereof ye may say that <!-- Page 381
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"></a>[pg 381]</span> ye have
  thought good to advertise him, to the intent he make no farther promise
  to the pope therein than may be performed."</p>

  <p>The ambassadors were the more emphatically to insist on the king's
  resolution, lest Francis, in his desire for conciliation, might hold out
  hopes to the pope which could not be realised. They were to say, however,
  that the King of England still trusted that the interview would not take
  place. The see of Rome was asserting a jurisdiction which, if conceded,
  would encourage an unlimited usurpation. If princes might be cited to the
  papal courts in a cause of matrimony, they might be cited equally in
  other causes at the pope's pleasure; and the free kingdoms of Europe
  would be converted into dependent provinces of the see of Rome. It
  concerned alike the interest and the honour of all sovereigns to resist
  encroachments which pointed to such an issue; and, therefore, Henry said
  he hoped that his good brother would use the pope as he had deserved,
  "doing him to understand his folly, and [that] unless he had first made
  amends, he could not find in his heart to have further amity with
  him."</p>

  <p>If notwithstanding, the instructions concluded, "all these persuasions
  cannot have place to let the said meeting, and the French king shall say
  it is expedient for him to have in his hands the duchess,<a
  name="NtA_614"></a><a href="#Nt_614"><sup>614</sup></a> under pretence of
  marriage for his son, which he cannot obtain but by this means, ye shall
  say that ye remember ye heard him say once he would never conclude that
  marriage but to do us good, which is now infaisible; and now in the voice
  of the world shall do us both more hurt in the diminution of the
  reputation of our amity than it should do otherwise profit. Nevertheless,
  [if] ye cannot let his precise determination, [ye] can but lament and
  bewail your own chance to depart home in this sort; and that yet of the
  two inconvenients, it is to you more tolerable to return to us nothing
  done, than to be present at the interview and to be compelled to look
  patiently upon your master's enemy."</p>

  <p>After having entered thus their protest against the French king's
  conduct, the embassy was to return to England, leaving a parting
  intimation of the single condition under which Henry would consent to
  treat. If the pope would declare that "the matrimony with the Lady
  Catherine was and is nought, he should do somewhat not to be refused;"
  except with this preliminary, no offer whatever could be entertained.<a
  name="NtA_615"></a><a href="#Nt_615"><sup>615</sup></a></p>

  <p>This communication, as Henry anticipated, was not more <!-- Page 382
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>[pg 382]</span> effectual
  than the former in respect of its immediate object. At the meeting of
  Calais the interests of Francis had united him with England, and in
  pursuing the objects of Henry he was then pursuing his own. The pope and
  the emperor had dissolved the coalition by concessions on the least
  dangerous side. The interests of Francis lay now in the other direction,
  and there are few instances in history in which governments have adhered
  to obligations against their advantage from a spirit of honour, when the
  purposes with which they contracted those obligations have been otherwise
  obtained. The English embassy returned as they were ordered; the French
  court pursued their way to Marseilles; not quarrelling with England;
  intending to abide by the alliance, and to give all proofs of amity which
  did not involve inconvenient sacrifices; but producing on the world at
  large by their conduct the precise effect which Henry had foretold. The
  world at large, looking to acts rather than to words, regarded the
  interview as a contrivance to reconcile Francis and the emperor through
  the intervention of the pope, as a preliminary for a packed council, and
  for a holy war against the Lutherans<a name="NtA_616"></a><a
  href="#Nt_616"><sup>616</sup></a>&mdash;a combination of ominous augury
  to Christendom, from the consequences of which, if Germany was to be the
  first sufferer, England would be inevitably the second.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as the French alliance threatened to fail, the English
  government found themselves driven at last to look for a connection among
  those powers from whom they had hitherto most anxiously disconnected
  themselves. At such a time. Protestant Germany, not Catholic France, was
  England's natural friend. The Reformation was essentially a Teutonic
  movement; the Germans, the English, the Scotch, the Swedes, the
  Hollanders, all were struggling on their various roads towards an end
  essentially the same. The same dangers threatened them, the same
  inspiration moved them; and in the eyes of the orthodox Catholics they
  were united in a black communion of heresy. Unhappily, though this
  identity was obvious to their enemies, it was far from obvious to
  themselves. <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page383"></a>[pg 383]</span> The odium theologicum is ever hotter
  between sections of the same party which are divided by trifling
  differences, than between the open representatives of antagonist
  principles; and Anglicans and Lutherans, instead of joining hands across
  the Channel, endeavoured only to secure each a recognition of themselves
  at the expense of the other. The English plumed themselves on their
  orthodoxy. They were "not as those publicans," heretics, despisers of the
  keys, disobedient to authority; they desired only the independence of
  their national church, and they proved their zeal for the established
  faith with all the warmth of persecution. To the Germans national freedom
  was of wholly minor moment, in comparison with the freedom of the soul;
  the orthodoxy of England was as distasteful to the disciples of Luther as
  the orthodoxy of Rome&mdash;and the interests of Europe were sacrificed
  on both sides to this foolish and fatal disunion. Circumstances indeed
  would not permit the division to remain in its first intensity, and their
  common danger compelled the two nations into a partial understanding. Yet
  the reconciliation, imperfect to the last, was at the outset all but
  impossible. Their relations were already embittered by many reciprocal
  acts of hostility. Henry VIII. had won his spurs as a theologian by an
  attack on Luther. Luther had replied by a hailstorm of invectives. The
  Lutheran books had been proscribed, the Lutherans themselves had' been
  burnt by Henry's bishops. The Protestant divines in Germany had attempted
  to conciliate the emperor by supporting the cause of Catherine; and
  Luther himself had spoken loudly in condemnation of the king. The
  elements of disunion were so many and so powerful, that there was little
  hope of contending against them successfully. Nevertheless, as Henry saw,
  the coalition of Francis and the emperor, if the pope succeeded in
  cementing it, was a most serious danger, to which an opposite alliance
  would alone be an adequate counterpoise; and the experiment might at
  least be tried whether such an alliance was possible. At the beginning of
  August, therefore, Stephen Vaughan was sent on a tentative mission to the
  Elector of Saxe, John Frederick, at Weimar.<a name="NtA_617"></a><a
  href="#Nt_617"><sup>617</sup></a> He was the bearer of letters containing
  a proposal for a resident English ambassador; and if the elector gave his
  consent, he was to proceed with similar offers to the courts of the
  Landgrave of Hesse and the Duke of Lunenberg.<a name="NtA_618"></a><a
  href="#Nt_618"><sup>618</sup></a> Vaughan <!-- Page 384 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page384"></a>[pg 384]</span> arrived in due time
  at the elector's court, was admitted to audience and delivered his
  letters. The prince read them, and in the evening of the same day
  returned for answer a polite but wholly absolute refusal. Being but a
  prince elector, he said, he might not aspire to so high an honour as to
  be favoured with the presence of an English ambassador. It was not the
  custom in Germany, and he feared that if he consented he should displease
  the emperor.<a name="NtA_619"></a><a href="#Nt_619"><sup>619</sup></a>
  The meaning of such a reply delivered in a few hours was not to be
  mistaken, however disguised in courteous language. The English emissary
  saw that he was an unwelcome visitor, and that he must depart with the
  utmost celerity. "The elector," he wrote,<a name="NtA_620"></a><a
  href="#Nt_620"><sup>620</sup></a> "thirsted to have me gone from him,
  which I right well perceived by evident tokens which declared unto me the
  same." He had no anxiety to expose to hazard the toleration which the
  Protestant dukedoms as yet enjoyed from the emperor, by committing
  himself to a connection with a prince with whose present policy he had no
  sympathy, and whose conversion to the cause of the Reformation he had as
  yet no reason to believe sincere.<a name="NtA_621"></a><a
  href="#Nt_621"><sup>621</sup></a></p>

  <p>The reception which Vaughan met with at Weimar satisfied him that he
  need go no further; neither the Landgrave nor the Duke of Lunenberg would
  be likely to venture on a course which the elector so obviously feared.
  He, therefore, gave up his mission, and returned to England.</p>

  <p>The first overtures in this direction issued in complete failure, nor
  was the result wholly to be regretted. It taught Henry (or it was a first
  commencement of the lesson) that so long as he pursued a merely English
  policy he might not expect that other nations would embroil themselves in
  his defence. He must <!-- Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page385"></a>[pg 385]</span> allow the Reformation a wider scope,
  he must permit it to comprehend within its possible consequences the
  breaking of the chains by which his subjects' minds were bound&mdash;not
  merely a change of jailors. Then perhaps the German princes might return
  some other answer.</p>

  <p>The disappointment, however, fell lightly; for before the account of
  the failure had reached England, an event had happened, which, poor as
  the king might be in foreign alliances, had added most material strength
  to his position in England. The full moment of that event he had no means
  of knowing. In its immediate bearing it was matter for most abundant
  satisfaction. On the seventh of September, between three and four in the
  afternoon, at the palace of Greenwich, was born a princess, named three
  days later in her baptism, after the king's mother, Elizabeth.<a
  name="NtA_622"></a><a href="#Nt_622"><sup>622</sup></a> A son had been
  hoped for. The child was a daughter only; yet at least Providence had not
  pronounced against the marriage by a sentence of barrenness; at least
  there was now an heir whose legitimacy the nation had agreed to accept.
  Te Deums were sung in all the churches; again the river decked itself in
  splendour; again all London steeples were musical with bells. A font of
  gold was presented for the christening. Francis, in compensation for his
  backslidings, had consented to be godfather; and the infant, who was soon
  to find her country so rude a stepmother, was received with all the
  outward signs of exulting welcome. To Catherine's friends the offspring
  of the rival marriage was not welcome, but was an object rather of bitter
  hatred; and the black cloud of a sister's jealousy gathered over the
  cradle whose innocent occupant had robbed her of her title and her
  expectations. To the king, to the parliament, to the healthy heart of
  England, she was an object of eager hope and an occasion for thankful
  gratitude; but the seeds were sown with her birth of those misfortunes
  which were soon to overshadow her, and to form the school of the great
  nature which in its maturity would re-mould the world.</p>

  <p>Leaving Elizabeth for the present, we return to the continent, and to
  the long-promised interview, which was now at last approaching. Henry
  made no further attempt to remonstrate with Francis; and Francis assured
  him, and with all sincerity, that he would use his best efforts to move
  the pope to make the necessary concessions. The English embassy meanwhile
  was withdrawn. The excommunication had been received as an act <!-- Page
  386 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page386"></a>[pg 386]</span> of
  hostility, of which Henry would not even condescend to complain; and it
  was to be understood distinctly that in any exertions which might be made
  by the French king, the latter was acting without commission on his own
  responsibility. The intercession was to be the spontaneous act of a
  mutual friend, who, for the interests of Christendom, desired to heal a
  dangerous wound; but neither directly nor indirectly was it to be
  interpreted as an expression of a desire for a reconciliation on the
  English side.</p>

  <p>It was determined further, on the recal of the Duke of Norfolk, that
  the opportunity of the meeting should be taken to give a notice to the
  pope of the king's appeal to the council; and for this purpose, Bennet
  and Bonner were directed to follow the papal court from Rome. Bennet
  never accomplished this journey, dying on the route, worn out with much
  service.<a name="NtA_623"></a><a href="#Nt_623"><sup>623</sup></a> His
  death delayed Bonner, and the conferences had opened for many days before
  his arrival. Clement had reached Marseilles by ship from Genoa, about the
  20th of October. As if pointedly to irritate Henry, he had placed himself
  under the conduct of the Duke of Albany.<a name="NtA_624"></a><a
  href="#Nt_624"><sup>624</sup></a> He was followed two days later by his
  fair niece, Catherine de Medici; and the preparations for the marriage
  were commenced with the utmost swiftness and secrecy. The conditions of
  the contract were not allowed to transpire, but they were concluded in
  three days; and on this 25th of October the pope bestowed his precious
  present on the Duke of Orleans, he himself performing the nuptial
  ceremony, and accompanying it with his paternal benediction on the young
  pair, and on the happy country which was to possess them for its king and
  queen. France being thus securely riveted to Rome, other matters could be
  talked of more easily. Francis made all decent overtures to the pope in
  behalf of Henry; if the pope was to be believed indeed, he was vehemently
  urgent.<a name="NtA_625"></a><a href="#Nt_625"><sup>625</sup></a> Clement
  in turn made suggestions for terms of alliance between Francis and
  Charles, "to the advantage of the Most Christian <!-- Page 387 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span> king;"<a
  name="NtA_626"></a><a href="#Nt_626"><sup>626</sup></a> and thus parried
  the remonstrances. The only point positively clear to the observers, was
  the perfect understanding which existed between the King of France and
  his spiritual father.<a name="NtA_627"></a><a
  href="#Nt_627"><sup>627</sup></a> Unusual activity was remarked in the
  dockyards; Italian soldiers of fortune were about the court in unusual
  numbers, and apparently in favour.<a name="NtA_628"></a><a
  href="#Nt_628"><sup>628</sup></a> An invasion of Lombardy was talked of
  among the palace retinue; and the emperor was said to distrust the
  intentions of the conference. Possibly experience had taught all parties
  to doubt each other's faith. Possibly they were all in some degree
  waiting upon events; and had not yet resolved upon their conduct.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this scene arrived Doctor Bonner, in the beginning of
  November, with Henry's appeal. He was a strange figure to appear in such
  a society. There was little probity, perhaps, either in the court of
  France, or in their Italian visitors: but of refinement, of culture, of
  those graces which enable men to dispense with the more austere
  excellences of character&mdash;which transform licentiousness into
  elegant frailty, and treachery and falsehood into pardonable
  finesse&mdash;of these there was very much: and when a rough, coarse,
  vulgar Englishman was plunged among these delicate ladies and gentlemen,
  he formed an element which contrasted strongly with the general
  environment. Yet Banner, perhaps, was not without qualifications which
  fitted him for his mission. He was not, indeed, virtuous; but he had a
  certain downright honesty about him, joined with an entire insensibility
  to those finer perceptions which would have interfered with plain
  speaking, where plain speaking was desirable; he had a broad, not
  ungenial humour, which showed him things and persons in their genuine
  light, and enabled him to picture them for us with a distinctness for
  which we owe him lasting thanks.</p>

  <p>He appeared at Marseilles on the 7th of November, and had much
  difficulty in procuring an interview. At length, weary of waiting, and
  regardless of the hot lead with which he had been lately threatened, he
  forced his way into the room where "the pope was standing, with the
  Cardinals De Lorraine and Medici, ready apparelled with his stole to go
  to the consistory."</p>

  <p>"Incontinently upon my coming thither," he wrote to Henry,<a
  name="NtA_629"></a><a href="#Nt_629"><sup>629</sup></a> "the pope, whose
  sight is incredulous quick, eyed me, and that <!-- Page 388 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>[pg 388]</span> divers times;
  making a good pause in one place; at which time I desired the datary to
  advertise his Holiness that I would speak with him; and albeit the datary
  made no little difficulty therein, yet perceiving that upon refusal I
  would have gone forthwith to the pope, he advertised the pope of my said
  desire. His Holiness dismissing as then the said cardinals, and letting
  his vesture fall, went to a window in the said chamber, calling me unto
  him. At which time I showed unto his Holiness how that your Highness had
  given me express and strait commandment to intimate unto him how that
  your Grace had solemnly provoked and appealed unto the general council;
  submitting yourself to the tuition and defence thereof; which provocation
  and appeal I had under authentic writings then with me, to show for that
  purpose. And herewithal I drew out the said writing, showing his said
  Holiness that I brought the same in proof of the premises, and that his
  Holiness might see and perceive all the same. The pope having this for a
  breakfast, only pulled down his head to his shoulders, after the Italian
  fashion, and said that because he was as then fully ready to go into the
  consistory, he would not tarry to hear or see the said writings, but
  willed me to come at afternoon."</p>

  <p>The afternoon came, and Bonner returned, and was admitted. There was
  some conversation upon indifferent matters; the pope making good-natured
  inquiries about Bennet, and speaking warmly and kindly of him.</p>

  <p>"Presently," Bonner continues, "falling out of that, he said that he
  marvelled your Highness would use his Holiness after such sort as it
  appears ye did. I said that your Highness no less did marvel that his
  Holiness having found so much benevolence and kindness at your hands in
  all times past, would for acquittal show such unkindness as of late he
  did. And here we entered in communication upon two points: one was that
  his Holiness, having committed in times past, and in most ample form, the
  cause into the realm, promising not to revoke the said commission, and
  over that, to confirm the process and sentence of the commissaries,
  should not at the point of sentence have advoked the cause, retaining it
  at Rome&mdash;forasmuch as Rome was a place whither your Highness could
  not, ne yet ought, personally to come unto, and also was not bound to
  send thither your proctor. The second point was, that your Highness's
  cause being, in the opinion of the best learned men in Christendom,
  approved good and just, and so [in] many ways known <!-- Page 389
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page389"></a>[pg 389]</span> unto his
  Holiness, the same should not so long have retained it in his hands
  without judgment.</p>

  <p>"His Holiness answering the same, as touching the first point, said
  that if the queen (meaning the late wife of Prince Arthur, calling her
  always in his conversation the queen) had not given an oath refusing the
  judges as suspect, he would not have advoked the matter at all, but been
  content that it should have been determined and ended in your realm. But
  seeing she gave that oath, appealing also to his court, he might and
  ought to hear her, his promise made to your Highness, which was
  qualified, notwithstanding. As touching the second point, his Holiness
  said that your Highness only was the default thereof, because ye would
  not send a proxy to the cause. These matters, however, he said, had been
  many times fully talked upon at Rome; and therefore [he] willed me to
  omit further communication thereupon, and to proceed to the doing of such
  things that I was specially sent for.</p>

  <p>"Whereupon making protestation of your Highness's mind and intent
  towards the see apostolic&mdash;not intending anything to do in contempt
  of the same&mdash;I exhibited unto his Holiness the commission which your
  Highness had sent unto me; and his Holiness delivering it to the datary,
  commanded him to read it; and hearing in the same the words (referring to
  the injuries which he had done to your Highness), he began to look up
  after a new sort, and said, 'O questo et multo vero! (this is much
  true!)' meaning that it was not true indeed. And verily, sure not only in
  this, but also in many parts of the said commission, he showed himself
  grievously offended; insomuch that, when those words, 'To the next
  general council which shall be lawfully held in place convenient,' were
  read, he fell in a marvellous great choler and rage, not only declaring
  the same by his gesture and manner, but also by words: speaking with
  great vehemence, and saying, 'Why did not the king, when I wrote to my
  nuncio this year past, to speak unto him for this general council, give
  no answer unto my said nuncio, but referred him for answer to the French
  king? at what time he might perceive by my doing, that I was very well
  disposed, and much spake for it.' 'The thing so standing, now to speak of
  a general council! Oh, good Lord! but well! his commission and all his
  other writings cannot be but welcome unto me;' which words methought he
  spake willing to hide his choler, and make me believe that he was nothing
  angry with their doings, when in vary deed I perceived, by many
  arguments, that it was otherwise. And one among <!-- Page 390 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page390"></a>[pg 390]</span> others was taken
  here for infallible with them that knoweth the pope's conditions, that he
  was continually folding up and unwinding of his handkerchief, which he
  never doth but when he is tickled to the very heart with great
  choler."</p>

  <p>At length the appeal was read through; and at the close of it Francis
  entered, and talked to the pope for some time, but in so low a voice that
  Bonner could not hear what was passing. When he had gone, his Holiness
  said that he would deliberate upon the appeal with the consistory, and
  after hearing their judgments would return his answer.</p>

  <p>Three days passed, and then the English agent was informed that he
  might again present himself. The pope had recovered his calmness. When he
  had time to collect himself, Clement could speak well and with dignity;
  and if we could forget that his conduct was substantially unjust, and
  that in his conscience he knew it to be unjust, he would almost persuade
  us to believe him honest. "He said," wrote Bonner, "that his mind towards
  your Highness always had been to minister justice, and to do pleasure to
  you; albeit it hath not been so taken: and he never unjustly grieved your
  Grace that he knoweth, nor intendeth hereafter to do. As concerning the
  appeal, he said that, forasmuch as there was a constitution of Pope Pius,
  his predecessor, that did condemn and reprove all such appeals, he did
  therefore reject your Grace's appeal as frivolous, forbidden, and
  unlawful." As touching the council, he said generally, that he would do
  his best that it should meet; but it was to be understood that the
  calling a general council belonged to him, and not to the King of
  England.</p>

  <p>The audience ended, and Bonner left the pope convinced that he
  intended, on his return to Rome, to execute the censures and continue the
  process without delay. That the sentence which he would pronounce would
  be against the king appeared equally certain.</p>

  <p>It appeared certain, yet after all no certain conclusion is possible.
  Francis I., though not choosing to quarrel with the see of Rome to do a
  pleasure to Henry, was anxious to please his ally to the extent of his
  convenience; at any rate, he would not have gratuitously deceived him;
  and still less would he have been party to an act of deliberate
  treachery. When Bonner was gone he had a last interview with the pope, in
  which he urged upon him the necessity of complying with Henry's demands;
  and the pope on this occasion said that he was satisfied that the King of
  England was right; that his cause was <!-- Page 391 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page391"></a>[pg 391]</span> good; and that he
  had only to acknowledge the papal jurisdiction by some formal act, to
  find sentence immediately pronounced in his favour. Except for his
  precipitation, and his refusal to depute a proxy to plead for him, his
  wishes would have been complied with long before. In the existing posture
  of affairs, and after the measures which had been passed in England with
  respect to the see of Rome, he himself, the pope said, could not make
  advances without some kind of submission; but a single act of
  acknowledgment was all which he required.<a name="NtA_630"></a><a
  href="#Nt_630"><sup>630</sup></a></p>

  <p>Extraordinary as it must seem, the pope certainly bound himself by
  this engagement: and who can tell with what intention? To believe him
  sincere and to believe him false seems equally impossible. If he was
  persuaded that Henry's cause <i>was</i> good, why did he in the following
  year pronounce finally for Catherine? why had he imperilled so needlessly
  the interests of the papacy in England? why had his conduct from the
  beginning pointed steadily to the conclusion at which he at last arrived?
  and why throughout Europe were the ultramontane party, to a man, on
  Catherine's side? On the other hand, what object at such a time can be
  conceived for falsehood? Can we suppose that he designed to dupe Henry
  into submission by a promise which he had predetermined to break? It is
  hard to suppose even Clement capable of so elaborate an act of perfidy;
  and it is, perhaps, idle to waste conjectures on the motives of a weak,
  much-agitated man. He was, probably, but giving a fresh example of his
  disposition to say at each moment whatever would be most agreeable to his
  hearers. This was his unhappy habit, by which he earned for himself a
  character for dishonesty, I labour to think, but half deserved.</p>

  <p>If, however, Clement meant to deceive, he succeeded, undoubtedly, in
  deceiving the French king. Francis, in communicating to Henry the
  language which the pope had used, entreated him to reconsider his
  resolution. The objection to pleading at Rome might be overcome; for the
  pope would meet him in a middle course. Judges could be appointed, who
  should sit at Cambray, and pass a sentence in condemnation of the
  original marriage; with a definite promise that their sentence should not
  again be called in question. To this arrangement there could be no
  reasonable objection; and Francis implored that a proposal so liberal
  should not be rejected. Sufficient danger already threatened Christendom,
  from heretics <!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page392"></a>[pg 392]</span> within and from the Turks without; and
  although the English parliament were agreed to maintain the second
  marriage, it was unwise to provoke the displeasure of foreign princes. To
  allow time for the preliminary arrangements, the execution of the
  censures had been further postponed; and if Henry would make up the
  quarrel, the French monarch was commissioned to offer a league, offensive
  and defensive, between England, France, and the Papacy. He himself only
  desired to be faithful to his engagements to his good brother; and as a
  proof of his good faith, he said that he had been offered the Duchy of
  Milan, if he would look on while the emperor and the pope attacked
  England.<a name="NtA_631"></a><a href="#Nt_631"><sup>631</sup></a></p>

  <p>This language bears all the character of sincerity; and when we
  remember that it followed immediately upon a close and intimate
  communication of three weeks with Clement, it is not easy to believe that
  he could have mistaken the extent of the pope's promises. We may suppose
  Clement for the moment to have been honest, or wavering between honesty
  and falsehood; we may suppose further that Francis trusted him because it
  was undesirable to be suspicious, in the belief that he was discharging
  the duty of a friend to Henry, and of a friend to the church, in offering
  to mediate upon these terms.</p>

  <p>But Henry was far advanced beyond the point at which fair words could
  move him. He had trusted many times, and had been many times deceived. It
  was not easy to entangle him again. It mattered little whether Clement
  was weak or false; the result was the same&mdash;he could not be trusted.
  To an open English understanding there was something monstrous in the
  position of a person professing to be a judge, who admitted that a cause
  which lay before him was so clear that he could bind himself to a
  sentence upon it, and could yet refuse to pronounce that sentence, except
  upon conditions. It was scarcely for the interests of justice to leave
  the distribution of it in hands so questionable.</p>

<!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page393"></a>[pg 393]</span>

  <p>Instead, therefore, of coming forward, as Francis hoped, instead of
  consenting to entangle himself again in the meshes of diplomatic
  intrigue, the king returned a peremptory refusal.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Norfolk, and such of the council as dreaded the completion
  of the schism, assured d'Inteville, the French ambassador, that for
  themselves they considered Francis was doing the best for England which
  could be done, and that they deprecated violent measures as much as
  possible; but in all this party there was a secret leaning to Queen
  Catherine, a dislike of Queen Anne and the whole Boleyn race, and a
  private hope and belief that the pope would after all be firm. Their
  tongues were therefore tied. They durst not speak except alone in
  whispers to each other; and the French ambassador, who did dare, only
  drew from Henry a more determined expression of his resolution.</p>

  <p>As to his measures in England, the king said, the pope had begun the
  quarrel by issuing censures and by refusing to admit his reasons for
  declining to plead at Rome. He was required to send a proctor, and was
  told that the cause should be decided in favour of whichever party was so
  represented there. For the sake of all other princes as well as himself,
  he would send no proctor, nor would he seem to acquiesce in the pretences
  of the papal see. The King of France told him that the pope admitted the
  justice of his cause. Let the pope do justice, then. The laws passed in
  parliament were for the benefit of the commonwealth, and he would never
  revoke them. He demanded no reparation, and could make no reparation. He
  asked only for his right, and if he could not obtain it, he had God and
  truth on his side, and that was enough. In vain d'Inteville answered
  feebly, that his master had done all that was in his power; the king
  replied that the French council wished to entangle him with the pope; but
  for his own part he would never more acknowledge the pope in his
  pretended capacity. He might be bishop of Rome, or pope also, if he
  preferred the name; but the see of Rome should have no more jurisdiction
  in England, and he thought he would be none the worse Christian on that
  account, but rather the better. Jesus Christ he would acknowledge, and
  him only, as the true Lord of Christian men, and Christ's word only
  should be preached in England. The Spaniards might invade him as they
  threatened. He did not fear them. They might come, but they might not
  find it so easy to return.<a name="NtA_632"></a><a
  href="#Nt_632"><sup>632</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page394"></a>[pg 394]</span>

  <p>The King had taken his position and was prepared for the consequences.
  He had foreseen for more than a year the possibility of an attempted
  invasion; and since his marriage, he had been aware that the chances of
  success in the adventure had been discussed on the Continent by the papal
  and imperial party. The pope had spoken of his censures being enforced,
  and Francis had revealed to Henry the nature of the dangerous overtures
  which had been made to himself. The Lutheran princes had hurriedly
  declined to connect themselves in any kind of alliance with England; and
  on the 25th of September, Stephen Vaughan had reported that troops were
  being raised in Germany, which rumour destined for Catherine's service.<a
  name="NtA_633"></a><a href="#Nt_633"><sup>633</sup></a> Ireland, too, as
  we shall hear in the next chapter, was on the verge of an insurrection,
  which had been fomented by papal agents.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, there was no real danger from an invasion, unless it was
  accompanied with an insurrection at home, or with a simultaneous attack
  from Scotland; and while of the first there appeared upon the surface no
  probability, with Scotland a truce for a year had been concluded on the
  1st of October.<a name="NtA_634"></a><a href="#Nt_634"><sup>634</sup></a>
  The king, therefore, had felt himself reasonably secure. Parliament had
  seemed unanimous; the clergy were submissive; the nation acquiescent or
  openly approving;<a name="NtA_635"></a><a
  href="#Nt_635"><sup>635</sup></a> and as late as the beginning of
  November, 1533, no suspicion seems to have been entertained of the spread
  of serious disaffection. A great internal revolution had been
  accomplished; a conflict of centuries between the civil and spiritual
  powers had been terminated without a life lost or a blow struck. Partial
  murmurs there had been, but murmurs were inevitable, and, so far as the
  government yet knew, were harmless. The Scotch war had threatened to be
  dangerous, but it had been extinguished. Impatient monks had denounced
  the king from the pulpits, and disloyal language had been reported from
  other quarters, which had roused vigilance, but <!-- Page 395 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span> had not created
  alarm. The Nun of Kent had forced herself into the royal presence with
  menacing prophecies; but she had appeared to be a harmless dreamer, who
  could only be made of importance by punishment. The surface of the nation
  was in profound repose. Cromwell, like Walsingham after him, may perhaps
  have known of the fire which was smouldering below, and have watched it
  silently till the moment came at which to trample it out; but no symptom
  of uneasiness appears either in the conduct of the government or in the
  official correspondence. The organisation of the friars, the secret
  communication of the Nun with Catherine and the Princess Mary, with the
  papal nuncio, or with noble lords and reverend bishops, was either
  unknown, or the character of those communications was not suspected. That
  a serious political conspiracy should have shaped itself round the
  ravings of a seeming lunatic, to all appearance had not occurred as a
  possibility to a single member of the council, except to those whose
  silence was ensured by their complicity.</p>

  <p>So far as we are able to trace the story (for the links of the chain
  which led to the discovery of the design's which were entertained, are
  something imperfect), the suspicions of the government were first roused
  in the following manner:</p>

  <p>Queen Catherine, as we have already seen, had been called upon, at the
  coronation of Anne Boleyn, to renounce her title, and she had refused.
  Mary had been similarly deprived of her rank as princess; but either her
  disgrace was held to be involved in that of her mother, or some other
  cause, perhaps the absence of immediate necessity, had postponed the
  demand for her own personal submission. As, however, on the publication
  of the second marriage, it had been urged on Catherine that there could
  not be two queens in England, so on the birth of the Princess Elizabeth,
  an analogous argument required the disinheritance of Mary. It was a hard
  thing; but her mother's conduct obliged the king to be peremptory. She
  might have been legitimatised by act of parliament, if Catherine would
  have submitted. The consequences of Catherine's refusal might be cruel,
  but they were unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Mary was not with her mother. It had been held desirable to remove her
  from an influence which would encourage her in a useless opposition; and
  she was residing at Beaulieu, afterwards New Hall, in Essex, under the
  care of Lord Hussey and the Countess of Salisbury. Lord Hussey was a
  dangerous guardian; he was subsequently executed for his complicity in
  the Pilgrimage <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page396"></a>[pg 396]</span> of Grace, the avowed object of which
  was the restoration of Mary to her place as heir-apparent. We may
  believe, therefore, that while under his surveillance she experienced no
  severe restraint, nor received that advice with respect to her conduct
  which prudence would have dictated. Lord Hussey, however, for the present
  enjoyed the confidence of the king, and was directed to inform his
  charge, that for the future she was to consider herself not as princess,
  but as the king's natural daughter, the Lady Mary Tudor. The message was
  a painful one; painful, we will hope, more on her mother's account than
  on her own; but her answer implied that, as yet, Henry VIII. was no
  object of especial terror to his children.</p>

  <p>"Her Grace replied," wrote Lord Hussey to the council in communicating
  the result of his undertaking,<a name="NtA_636"></a><a
  href="#Nt_636"><sup>636</sup></a> that "she could not a little marvel
  that I being alone, and not associate with some other the king's most
  honourable council, nor yet sufficiently authorised neither by commission
  not by any other writing from the King's Highness, would attempt to
  declare such a high enterprise and matter of no little weight and
  importance unto her Grace, in diminishing her said estate and name; her
  Grace not doubting that she is the king's true and legitimate daughter
  and heir procreate in good and lawful matrimony; [and] further adding,
  that unless she were advertised from his Highness by his writing that his
  Grace was so minded to diminish her estate, name, and dignity, which she
  trusteth his Highness will never do, she would not believe it."</p>

  <p>Inasmuch as Mary was but sixteen at this time, the resolution which
  she displayed in sending such a message was considerable. The early
  English held almost Roman notions on the nature of parental authority,
  and the tone of a child to a father was usually that of the most
  submissive reverence. Nor was she contented with replying indirectly
  through her guardian. She wrote herself to the king, saying that she
  neither could nor would in her conscience think the contrary, but that
  she was his lawful daughter born in true matrimony, and that she thought
  that he in his own conscience did judge the same.<a name="NtA_637"></a><a
  href="#Nt_637"><sup>637</sup></a></p>

  <p>Such an attitude in so young a girl was singular, yet not necessarily
  censurable. Henry was not her only parent, and if we suppose her to have
  been actuated by affection for her mother, her conduct may appear not
  pardonable only, but spirited and <!-- Page 397 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page397"></a>[pg 397]</span> creditable. In
  insisting upon her legitimacy, nevertheless, she was not only asserting
  the good name and fame of Catherine of Arragon, but unhappily her own
  claim to the succession to the throne. It was natural that under the
  circumstances she should have felt her right to assert that claim; for
  the injury which she had suffered was patent not only to herself, but to
  Europe. Catherine might have been required to give way that the king
  might have a son, and that the succession might be established in a
  prince; but so long as the child of the second marriage was a daughter
  only, it seemed substantially monstrous to set aside the elder for the
  younger. Yet the measure was a harsh necessity; a link in the chain which
  could not be broken. The harassed nation insisted above all things that
  no doubt should hang over the future, and it was impossible in the
  existing complications to recognise the daughter of Catherine without
  excluding Elizabeth, and excluding the prince who was expected to follow
  her. By asserting her title, Mary was making herself the nucleus of
  sedition, which on her father's death would lead to a convulsion in the
  realm. She might not mean it, but the result would not be affected by a
  want of purpose in herself; and it was possible that her resolution might
  create immediate and far more painful complications. The king's
  excommunication was imminent, and if the censures were enforced by the
  emperor, she would be thrust into the unpermitted position of her
  father's rival.</p>

  <p>The political consequences of her conduct, notwithstanding, although
  evident to statesmen, might well be concealed from a headstrong,
  passionate girl. There was no suspicion that she herself was encouraging
  any of these dangerous thoughts, and Henry looked upon her answer to Lord
  Hussey and her letter to himself as expressions of petulant folly. Lord
  Oxford, the Earl of Essex, and the Earl of Sussex were directed to repair
  to Beaulieu, and explain to her the situation in which she had placed
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Considering," wrote the king to them, "how highly such contempt and
  rebellion done by our daughter and her servants doth touch not only us,
  and the surety of our honour and person, but also the tranquillity of our
  realm; and not minding to suffer the pernicious example hereof to spread
  far abroad, but to put remedy to the same in due time, we have given you
  commandment to declare to her the great folly, temerity, and indiscretion
  that she hath used herein, with the peril she hath incurred by reason of
  her so doing. By these her ungodly doings hitherto <!-- Page 398 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page398"></a>[pg 398]</span> she hath most
  worthily deserved our high indignation and displeasure, and thereto no
  less pain and punition than by the order of the laws of our realm doth
  appertain in case of high treason, unless our mercy and clemency should
  be shewed in that behalf. [If, however, after] understanding our mind and
  pleasure, [she will] conform herself humbly and obediently to the
  observation of the same, according to the office and duty of a natural
  daughter, and of a true and faithful subject, she may give us cause
  hereafter to incline our fatherly pity to her reconciliation, her benefit
  and advancement."<a name="NtA_638"></a><a
  href="#Nt_638"><sup>638</sup></a></p>

  <p>The reply of Mary to this message is not discoverable; but it is
  certain that she persisted in her resolution, and clung either to her
  mother's "cause" or to her own rank and privilege, in sturdy defiance of
  her father. To punish her insubordination or to tolerate it was equally
  difficult; and the government might have been in serious embarrassment
  had not a series of discoveries, following rapidly one upon the other,
  explained the mystery of these proceedings, and opened a view with
  alarming clearness into the under-currents of the feeling of the
  country.</p>

  <p>Information from time to time had reached Henry from Rome, relating to
  the correspondence between Catherine and the pope. Perhaps, too, he knew
  how assiduously she had importuned the emperor to force Clement to a
  decision.<a name="NtA_639"></a><a href="#Nt_639"><sup>639</sup></a> No
  effort, however, had been hitherto made to interfere with her
  hospitalities, or to oblige her visitors to submit to scrutiny before
  they could be <!-- Page 399 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page399"></a>[pg 399]</span> admitted to her presence. She was the
  mistress of her own court and of her own actions; and confidential
  agents, both from Rome, Brussels, and Spain, had undoubtedly passed and
  repassed with reciprocal instructions and directions.</p>

  <p>The crisis which was clearly approaching had obliged Henry, in the
  course of this autumn, to be more watchful; and about the end of October,
  or the beginning of November,<a name="NtA_640"></a><a
  href="#Nt_640"><sup>640</sup></a> two friars were reported as having been
  at Bugden, whose movements attracted suspicion from their anxiety to
  escape observation. Secret agents of the government, who had been "set"
  for the purpose, followed the friars to London, and notwithstanding "many
  wiles and cautells by them invented to escape," the suspected persons
  were arrested and brought before Cromwell. Cromwell, "upon examination"
  could gather nothing from them of any moment or great importance; but,
  "entering on further communication," he said, "he found one of them a
  very seditious person, and so committed them to ward." The king was
  absent from London, but had left directions that, in the event of any
  important occurrence of the kind, Archbishop Cranmer should be sent for;
  but Cranmer not being immediately at hand, Cromwell wrote to Henry for
  instructions; inasmuch as, he said, "it is undoubted that they (the
  monks) have intended, and would confess, some great matter, if they might
  be examined as they ought to be&mdash;that is to say, by pains."</p>

  <p>The curtain here falls over the two prisoners; we do not know whether
  they were tortured, whether they confessed, or what they confessed; but
  we may naturally connect this letter, directly or indirectly, with the
  events which immediately followed. In the middle of November we find a
  commission sitting at Lambeth, composed of Cromwell, Cranmer, and
  Latimer, ravelling out the threads of a story, from which, when the whole
  was disentangled, it appeared that by Queen Catherine, the Princess Mary,
  and a large and formidable party in the country, the king, on the faith
  of a pretended revelation, was supposed to have forfeited the crown; that
  his death, either by visitation of God or by visitation of man, was daily
  expected; and that whether his death took place or not, a revolution was
  immediately looked for, which would place the princess on the throne.</p>

  <p>The Nun of Kent, as we remember, had declared that if Henry persisted
  in his resolution of marrying Anne, she was commissioned by God to tell
  him that he should lose his power and <!-- Page 400 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span> authority. She had
  not specified the manner in which the sentence would be carried into
  effect against him. The form of her threats had been also varied
  occasionally; she said that he should die, but whether by the hands of
  his subjects, or by a providential judgment, she left to conjecture;<a
  name="NtA_641"></a><a href="#Nt_641"><sup>641</sup></a> and the period
  within which his punishment was to fall upon him was stated variously at
  one month or at six.<a name="NtA_642"></a><a
  href="#Nt_642"><sup>642</sup></a> She had attempted no secresy with these
  prophecies; she had confined herself in appearance to words; and the
  publicity which she courted having prevented suspicion of secret
  conspiracy, Henry quietly accepted the issue, and left the truth of the
  prophecy to be confuted by the event. He married. The one month passed;
  the six months passed; eight&mdash;nine months. His child was born and
  was baptised, and no divine thunder had interposed; only a mere harmless
  verbal thunder, from a poor old man at Rome. The illusion, as he
  imagined, had been lived down, and had expired of its own vanity.</p>

  <p>But the Nun and her friar advisers were counting on other methods of
  securing the fulfilment of the prophecy than supernatural assistance. It
  is remarkable that hypocrites and impostors as they knew themselves to
  be, they were not without a half belief that some supernatural
  intervention was imminent; but the career on which they had entered was
  too fascinating to allow them to forsake it when their expectation failed
  them. They were swept into the stream which was swelling to resist the
  Reformation, and allowed themselves to be hurried forward either to
  victory or to destruction.</p>

  <p>The first revelation being apparently confuted by facts, a second was
  produced as an interpretation of it; which, however, was not published
  like the other, but whispered in secret to persons whose dispositions
  were known.<a name="NtA_643"></a><a href="#Nt_643"><sup>643</sup></a></p>

  <p>"When the King's Grace," says the report of the commissioners, "had
  continued in good health, honour, and prosperity <!-- Page 401 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page401"></a>[pg 401]</span> more than a month,
  Dr. Bocking shewed the said Nun, that as King Saul, abjected from his
  kingdom by God, yet continued king in the sight of the world, so her said
  revelations might be taken. And therefore the said Nun, upon this
  information, forged another revelation, that her words should be
  understanded to mean that the King's Grace should not be king in the
  reputation or acceptation of God, not one month or one hour after that he
  married the Queen's Grace that now is. The first revelation had moved a
  great number of the king's subjects, both high and low, to grudge against
  the said marriage before it was concluded and perfected; and also induced
  such as were stiffly bent against that marriage, daily to look for the
  destruction of the King's Grace within a month after he married the
  Queen's Grace that now is. And when they were deluded in that
  expectation, the second revelation was devised not only as an
  interpretation of the former, but to the intent to induce the king's
  subjects to believe that God took the King's Grace for no king of this
  realm, and that they should likewise take him for no righteous king, and
  themselves not bounden to be his subjects; which might have put the King
  and the Queen's Grace in jeopardy of their crown and of their issue, and
  the people of this realm in great danger of destruction."<a
  name="NtA_644"></a><a href="#Nt_644"><sup>644</sup></a></p>

  <p>It was no light matter to pronounce the king to be in the position of
  Saul after his rejection; and read by the light of the impending
  excommunication, the Nun's words could mean nothing but treason. The
  speaker herself was in correspondence with the pope; she had attested her
  divine commission by miracles, and had been recognised as a saint by an
  Archbishop of Canterbury; the regular orders of the clergy throughout the
  realm were known to regard her as inspired; and when the commission
  recollected that the king was threatened further with dying "a villain's
  death;" and that these and similar prophecies were carefully written out,
  and were in private circulation through the country, the matter assumed a
  dangerous complexion: it became at once essential to ascertain how far,
  and among what classes of the state, these things had penetrated. The
  Friars Mendicant were discovered to be in league with her, and these
  itinerants were ready-made missionaries of sedition. They had privilege
  of vagrancy without check or limit; and owing to their universal
  distribution and the freemasonry among themselves, the secret disposition
  of every family in England was intimately known to them. No movement,
  therefore, <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page402"></a>[pg 402]</span> could be securely over-looked in which
  these orders had a share; the country might be undermined in secret; and
  the government might only learn their danger at the moment of
  explosion.</p>

  <p>No sooner, therefore, were the commissioners in possession of the
  general facts, than the principal parties&mdash;that is to say, the Nun
  herself and five of the monks of Christ Church at Canterbury&mdash;with
  whom her intercourse was most constant, were sent to the Tower to be
  "examined"&mdash;the monks it is likely by "torture," if they could not
  otherwise be brought to confession. The Nun was certainly not tortured.
  On her first arrest, she was obstinate in maintaining her prophetic
  character; and she was detected in sending messages to her friends, "to
  animate them to adhere to her and to her prophecies."<a
  name="NtA_645"></a><a href="#Nt_645"><sup>645</sup></a> But her courage
  ebbed away under the hard reality of her position. She soon made a full
  confession, in which her accomplices joined her; and the half-completed
  web of conspiracy was ravelled out. They did not attempt to conceal that
  they had intended, if possible, to create an insurrection. The five
  monks&mdash;Father Bocking, Father Rich, Father Rysby, Father Dering, and
  Father Goold&mdash;had assisted the Nun in inventing her "Revelations;"
  and as apostles, they had travelled about the country to communicate them
  in whatever quarters they were likely to be welcome. When we remember
  that Archbishop Warham had been a dupe of this woman, and that even
  Wolsey's experience and ability had not prevented him from believing in
  her power, we are not surprised to find high names among those who were
  implicated. Vast numbers of abbots and priors, and of regular and secular
  clergy, had listened eagerly; country gentlemen also, and London
  merchants. The Bishop of Rochester had "wept for joy" at the first
  utterances of the inspired prophetess; and Sir Thomas More, "who at first
  did little regard the said revelations, afterwards did greatly rejoice to
  hear of them."<a name="NtA_646"></a><a href="#Nt_646"><sup>646</sup></a>
  We learn, also, that the Nun had continued to <i>communicate with "the
  Lady Princess Dowager" and "the Lady Mary, her daughter."</i><a
  name="NtA_647"></a><a href="#Nt_647"><sup>647</sup></a></p>

  <p>These were names which might have furnished cause for regret, but
  little for surprise or alarm. The commissioners must have found occasion
  for other feelings, however, when among the persons implicated were found
  the Countess of Salisbury and the Marchioness of Exeter, with their
  chaplains, <!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page403"></a>[pg 403]</span> households, and servants; Sir Thomas
  Arundel, Sir George Carew, and "many of the nobles of England."<a
  name="NtA_648"></a><a href="#Nt_648"><sup>648</sup></a> A combination
  headed by the Countess of Salisbury, if she were supported even by a
  small section of the nobility, would under any circumstances have been
  dangerous; and if such a combination was formed in support of an
  invasion, and was backed by the blessings of the pope and the fanaticism
  of the clergy, the result might be serious indeed. So careful a silence
  is observed in the official papers on this feature of the Nun's
  conspiracy, that it is uncertain how far the countess had committed
  herself; but she had listened certainly to avowals of treasonable
  intentions without revealing them, which of itself was no slight evidence
  of disloyalty; and that the government were really alarmed may be
  gathered from the simultaneous arrest of Sir William and Sir George
  Neville, the brothers of Lord Latimer. The connection and significance of
  these names I shall explain presently; in the meantime I return to the
  preparations which had been made by the Nun.</p>

  <p>As the final judgment drew near&mdash;which, unless the king
  submitted, would be accompanied, with excommunication, and a declaration
  that the English nation was absolved from allegiance,&mdash;"the said
  false Nun," says the report, "surmised herself to have made a petition to
  God to know, when fearful war should come, whether any man should take my
  Lady Mary's part or no; and she feigned herself to have answer by
  revelation that no man should fear but that she should have succour and
  help enough; and that no man should put her from her right that she was
  born unto. And petitioning next to know when it was the pleasure of God
  that her revelations should be put forth to the world, she had answer
  that knowledge should be given to her ghostly father when it should be
  time."<a name="NtA_649"></a><a href="#Nt_649"><sup>649</sup></a></p>

  <p>With this information Father Goold had hastened down to Bugden,
  encouraging Catherine to persevere in her resistance;<a
  name="NtA_650"></a><a href="#Nt_650"><sup>650</sup></a> and while the
  imperialists at Rome were pressing the pope for <!-- Page 404 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page404"></a>[pg 404]</span> sentence (we cannot
  doubt at Catherine's instance), the Nun had placed herself in readiness
  to seize the opportunity when it offered, and to blow the trumpet of
  insurrection in the panic which might be surely looked for when that
  sentence should be published.</p>

  <p>For this purpose she had organised, with considerable skill, a corps
  of fanatical friars, who, when the signal was given, were simultaneously
  to throw themselves into the midst of the people, and call upon them to
  rise in the name of God. "To the intent," says the report, "to set forth
  this matter, certain spiritual and religious persons were appointed, as
  they had been chosen of God, to preach the false revelations of the said
  Nun, when the time should require, if warning were given them; and some
  of these preachers have confessed openly, and subscribed their names to
  their confessions, that if the Nun had so sent them word, they would have
  preached to the king's subjects that the pleasure of God was that they
  should take him no longer for their king; and some of these preachers
  were such as gave themselves to great fasting, watching, long prayers,
  wearing of shirts of hair and great chains of iron about their middle,
  whereby the people had them in high estimation of their great
  holiness,&mdash;and this strait life they took on them by the counsel and
  exhortation of the said Nun."<a name="NtA_651"></a><a
  href="#Nt_651"><sup>651</sup></a></p>

  <p>Here, then, was the explanation of the attitude of Catherine and Mary.
  Smarting under injustice, and most naturally blending their private
  quarrel with the cause of the church, they had listened to these
  disordered visions as to a message from heaven, and they had lent
  themselves to the first of those religious conspiracies which held
  England in chronic agitation for three quarters of a century. The
  innocent Saint at Bugden was the forerunner of the prisoner at
  Fotheringay; and the Observant friars, with their chain girdles and
  shirts of hair, were the antitypes of Parsons and Campion. How critical
  the situation of England really was, appears from the following letter of
  the French ambassador. The project for the marriage of the Princess Mary
  with the Dauphin had been revived by the Catholic party; and a private
  arrangement, of which this marriage was to form the connecting link, was
  contemplated between the Ultramontanes in France, the pope, and the
  emperor.</p>

<!-- Page 405 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page405"></a>[pg 405]</span>

<p class="center"><i>D'Inteville to Cardinal Tournon.</i><a name="NtA_652"></a><a href="#Nt_652"><sup>652</sup></a></p>

  <p>"MY LORD,&mdash;You will be so good as to tell the Most Christian king
  that the emperor's ambassador has communicated with the old queen. The
  emperor sends a message to her and to her daughter, that he will not
  return to Spain till he has seen them restored to their rights.</p>

  <p>"The people are so much attached to the said ladies that they will
  rise in rebellion, and join any prince who will undertake their quarrel.
  You probably know from other quarters the intensity of this feeling. It
  is shared by all classes, high and low, and penetrates even into the
  royal household.</p>

  <p>"The nation is in marvellous discontent. Every one but the relations
  of the present queen, is indignant on the ladies' account. Some fear the
  overthrow of religion; others fear war and injury to trade. Up to this
  time, the cloth, hides, wool, lead, and other merchandise of England have
  found markets in Flanders, Spain, and Italy; now it is thought navigation
  will be so dangerous that English merchants must equip their ships for
  war if they trade to foreign countries; and besides the risk of losing
  all to the enemy, the expense of the armament will swallow the profits of
  the voyage. In like manner, the emperor's subjects and the pope's
  subjects will not be able to trade with England. The coasts will be
  blockaded by the ships of the emperor and his allies; and at this moment
  men's fears are aggravated by the unseasonable weather throughout the
  summer, and the failure of the crops. There is not corn enough for half
  the ordinary consumption.</p>

  <p>"The common people, foreseeing these inconveniences, are so violent
  against the queen, that they say a thousand shameful things of her, and
  of all who have supported her in her intrigues. On them is cast the odium
  of all the calamities anticipated from the war.</p>

  <p>"When the war comes, no one doubts that the people will rebel as much
  from fear of the dangers which I have mentioned, as from the love which
  is felt for the two ladies, and especially for the Princess. She is so
  entirely beloved that, notwithstanding the law made at the last
  Parliament, and the menace of death contained in it, they persist in
  regarding her as Princess. No Parliament, they say, can make her anything
  but the king's <!-- Page 406 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page406"></a>[pg 406]</span> daughter, born in marriage; and so the
  king and every one else regarded her before that Parliament.</p>

  <p>"Lately, when she was removed from Greenwich, a vast crowd of women,
  wives of citizens and others, walked before her at their husbands'
  desire, weeping and crying that notwithstanding all she was Princess.
  Some of them were sent to the Tower, but they would not retract.</p>

  <p>"Things are now so critical, and the fear of war is so general, that
  many of the greatest merchants in London have placed themselves in
  communication with the emperor's ambassador, telling him, that if the
  emperor will declare war, the English nation will join him for the love
  they bear the Lady Mary.</p>

  <p>"You, my Lord, will remember that when you were here, it was said you
  were come to tell the king that he was excommunicated, and to demand the
  hand of the Princess for the Dauphin. The people were so delighted that
  they have never ceased to pray for you. We too, when we arrived in
  London, were told that the people were praying for us. They thought our
  embassy was to the Princess. They imagined her marriage with the Dauphin
  had been determined on by the two kings, and the satisfaction was intense
  and universal.</p>

  <p>"They believe that, except by this marriage, they cannot possibly
  escape war; whereas, can it be brought about, they will have peace with
  the emperor and all other Christian princes. They are now so disturbed
  and so desperate that, although at one time they would have preferred a
  husband for her from among themselves, that they might not have a foreign
  king, there now is nothing which they desire more. Unless the Dauphin
  will take her, they say she will continue disinherited; or, if she come
  to her rights, it can only be by battle, to the great incommodity of the
  country. The Princess herself says publicly that the Dauphin is her
  husband, and that she has no hope but in him. I have been told this by
  persons who have heard it from her own lips.</p>

  <p>"The emperor's ambassador inquired, after you came, whether we had
  seen her. He said he knew she was most anxious to speak with us; she
  thought we had permission to visit her, and she looked for good news. He
  told us, among other things, that she had been more strictly guarded of
  late, by the orders of the queen that now is, who, knowing her feeling
  for the Dauphin, feared there might be some practice with her, or some
  attempt to carry her off.</p>

  <p>"The Princess's ladies say that she calls herself the Dauphin's <!--
  Page 407 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page407"></a>[pg 407]</span>
  wife. A time will come, she says, when God will see that she has suffered
  pain and tribulation sufficient; the Dauphin will then demand her of the
  king her father, and the king her father will not be able to refuse.</p>

  <p>"The lady who was my informant heard, also, from the Princess, that
  her governess, and the other attendants whom the queen had set to watch
  her, had assured her that the Dauphin was married to the daughter of the
  emperor; but she, the Princess, had answered it was not true&mdash;the
  Dauphin could not have two wives, and they well knew that she was his
  wife: they told her that story, she said, to make her despair, and agree
  to give up her rights; but she would never part with her hopes.</p>

  <p>"You may have heard of the storm that broke out between her and her
  governess when we went to visit her little sister. She was carried off by
  force to her room, that she might not speak with us; and they could
  neither pacify her nor keep her still, till the gentleman who escorted us
  told her he had the king's commands that she was not to show herself
  while we were in the house. You remember the message the same gentleman
  brought to you from her, and the charge which was given by the queen.</p>

  <p>"Could the king be brought to consent to the marriage, it could be a
  fair union of two realms, and to annex Britain to the crown of France
  would be a great honour to our Sovereign; the English party desire
  nothing better; the pope will be glad of it; the pope fears that, if war
  break out again, France will draw closer to England on the terms which
  the King of England desires; and he may thus lose the French tribute as
  he has lost the English. He therefore will urge the emperor to agree, and
  the emperor will assist gladly for the love which he bears to his
  cousin.</p>

  <p>"If the emperor be willing, the King of England can then be informed;
  and he can be made to feel that, if he will avoid war, he must not refuse
  his consent. The king, in fact, has no wish to disown the Princess, and
  he knows well that the marriage with the Dauphin was once agreed on.</p>

  <p>"Should he be unwilling, and should his wife's persuasions stil have
  influence with him, he will hesitate before he will defy, for her sake,
  the King of France and the emperor united. His regard for the queen is
  less than it was, and diminishes every day. He has a new fancy,<a
  name="NtA_653"></a><a href="#Nt_653"><sup>653</sup></a> as you are
  aware."</p>

<!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page408"></a>[pg 408]</span>

  <p>The actual conspiracy, in the form which it had so far assumed, was
  rather an appeal to fanaticism than a plot which could have laid hold of
  the deeper mind of the country; but as an indication of the unrest which
  was stealing over the minds of men, it assumed an importance which it
  would not have received from its intrinsic character.</p>

  <p>The guilt of the principal offenders admitted of no doubt. As soon as
  the commissioners were satisfied that there was nothing further to be
  discovered, the Nun, with the monks, was brought to trial before the Star
  Chamber; and conviction followed as a matter of course.<a
  name="NtA_654"></a><a href="#Nt_654"><sup>654</sup></a></p>

  <p>The unhappy girl finding herself at this conclusion, after seven years
  of vanity, in which she had played with popes, and queens, and
  princesses, and archbishops, now, when the dream was thus rudely broken,
  in the revulsion of feeling could see nothing in herself but a convicted
  impostor. We need not refuse to pity her. The misfortunes of her sickness
  had exposed her to temptations far beyond the strength of an ordinary
  woman: and the guilt which she passionately claimed for herself rested
  far more truly with the knavery of the Christ Church monks and the
  incredible folly of Archbishop Warham.<a name="NtA_655"></a><a
  href="#Nt_655"><sup>655</sup></a> But the times were too stern to admit
  of nice distinctions. No immediate sentence was pronounced, but it was
  thought desirable for the satisfaction of the people that a confession
  should be made in public by the Nun and her companions. The Sunday
  following their trial they were placed on a raised platform at Paul's
  Cross by the side of the pulpit, and when the sermon was over they one by
  one delivered their "bills" to the preacher, which by him were read to
  the crowd.<a name="NtA_656"></a><a href="#Nt_656"><sup>656</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 409 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page409"></a>[pg 409]</span>

  <p>After an acknowledgment of their imposture the prisoners were remanded
  to the Tower, and their ultimate fate reserved for the consideration of
  parliament, which was to meet in the middle of January.</p>

  <p>The chief offenders being thus disposed of, the council resolved next
  that peremptory measures should be taken with respect to the Princess
  Mary.<a name="NtA_657"></a><a href="#Nt_657"><sup>657</sup></a> Her
  establishment was broken up, and she was sent to reside as the Lady Mary
  in the household of the Princess Elizabeth&mdash;a hard but not
  unwholesome discipline.<a name="NtA_658"></a><a
  href="#Nt_658"><sup>658</sup></a> As soon as this was done, being
  satisfied that the leading shoot of the conspiracy was broken, and that
  no immediate danger was now to be feared, they proceeded leisurely to
  follow the clue of the Nun's confession, and to extend their inquiries.
  The Countess of Salisbury was mentioned as one of the persons with whom
  the woman had been in correspondence. This lady was the daughter of the
  Duke of Clarence, brother of Edward IV. Her mother was a Neville, a child
  of Richard the Kingmaker, the famous Earl of Warwick, and her only
  brother had been murdered to secure the shaking throne of Henry VII.
  Margaret Plantagenet, in recompense for the lost honours of the house,
  was made Countess of Salisbury in her own right. The title descended from
  her grandfather, who was Earl of Salisbury and Warwick; but the prouder
  title had been dropped as suggestive of dangerous associations. The
  Earldom of Warwick remained in abeyance, and the castle and the estates
  attached to it were forfeited to the Crown. The countess was married
  after her brother's death to a Sir Richard Pole, a supporter and
  relation<a name="NtA_659"></a><a href="#Nt_659"><sup>659</sup></a> of the
  king; and when left a widow she received from Henry VIII. the respectful
  honour which was due to the most nobly born of his subjects, the only
  remaining Plantagenet of unblemished descent. In his kindness to her
  children the king had attempted to obliterate the recollection of her
  brother's wrongs, and she had been herself selected to preside over the
  household of the Princess Mary. During the first twenty years of Henry's
  reign the countess seems to have acknowledged his attentions with loyal
  regard, and if she had <!-- Page 410 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page410"></a>[pg 410]</span> not forgotten her birth and her
  childhood, she never connected herself with the attempts which during
  that time were made to revive the feuds of the houses. Richard de la
  Pole, nephew of Edward IV.,<a name="NtA_660"></a><a
  href="#Nt_660"><sup>660</sup></a> and called while he lived "the White
  Rose," had more than once endeavoured to excite an insurrection in the
  eastern counties; but Lady Salisbury was never suspected of holding
  intercourse with him; she remained aloof from political disputes, and in
  lofty retirement she was contented to forget her greatness for the sake
  of the Princess Mary, to whom she and her family were deeply attached.
  Her relations with the king had thus continued undisturbed until his
  second marriage. As the representative of the House of York she was the
  object of the hopes and affections of the remnants of their party, but
  she had betrayed no disposition to abuse her influence, or to disturb the
  quiet of the nation for personal ambition of her own.</p>

  <p>If it be lawful to interpret symptoms in themselves trifling by the
  light of later events, it would seem as if her attitude now underwent a
  material change. Her son Reginald had already quarrelled with the king
  upon the divorce. He was in suspicious connection with the pope, and
  having been required to return home upon his allegiance, had refused
  obedience. His mother, and his mother's attached friend, the Marchioness
  of Exeter, we now find among those to whom the Nun of Kent communicated
  her prophecies and her plans. It does not seem that the countess thought
  at any time of reviving her own pretensions; it does seem that she was
  ready to build a throne for the Princess Mary out of the ruined
  supporters of her father's family. The power which she could wield might
  at any moment become formidable. She had two sons in England, Lord
  Montague and Sir Geoffrey Pole. Her cousin, the Marquis of Exeter, a
  grandson himself of Edward IV.,<a name="NtA_661"></a><a
  href="#Nt_661"><sup>661</sup></a> was, with the exception of the Duke of
  Norfolk, the most powerful nobleman in the realm; and he, to judge by
  events, was beginning to look coldly on the king.<a name="NtA_662"></a><a
  href="#Nt_662"><sup>662</sup></a> We find her surrounded also by the
  representatives of her mother's family&mdash;Lord Abergavenny, who had
  been under suspicion when the Duke of Buckingham was executed, Sir Edward
  Neville, afterwards executed, Lord Latimer, Sir George and Sir William
  Neville, all of them were <!-- Page 411 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page411"></a>[pg 411]</span> her near connections, all collateral
  heirs of the King-maker, inheriting the pride of their birth, and
  resentfully conscious of their fallen fortunes. The support of a party so
  composed would have added formidable strength to the preaching friars of
  the Nun of Kent; and as I cannot doubt that the Nun was endeavouring to
  press her intrigues in a quarter where disaffection if created would be
  most dangerous, so the lady who ruled this party with a patriarchal
  authority had listened to her suggestions; and the repeated interviews
  with her which were sought by the Marchioness of Exeter were rendered
  more than suspicious by the secresy with which these interviews were
  conducted.<a name="NtA_663"></a><a href="#Nt_663"><sup>663</sup></a></p>

  <p>These circumstances explain the arrest, to which I alluded above, of
  Sir William and Sir George Neville, brothers of Lord Latimer. They were
  not among "the many noblemen" to whom the commissioners referred; for
  their confessions remain, and contain no allusion to the Nun; but they
  were examined at this particular time on general suspicion; and the
  arrest, under such circumstances, of two near relatives of Lady
  Salisbury, indicates clearly an alarm in the council, lest she might be
  contemplating some serious movements. At any rate, either on her account
  or on their own, the Nevilles fell under suspicion, and while they had no
  crimes to reveal, their depositions, especially that of Sir William
  Neville, furnish singular evidence of the temper of the times.</p>

  <p>The confession of the latter begins with an account of the loss of
  certain silver spoons, for the recovery of which Sir William sent to a
  wizard who resided in Cirencester. The wizard took the opportunity of
  telling Sir William's fortune: his wife was to die, and he himself was to
  marry an heiress, and be made a baron; with other prospective splendours.
  The wizard concluded, however, with recommending him to pay a visit to
  another dealer in the dark art more learned than himself, whose name was
  Jones, at Oxford.</p>

  <p>"So after that," said Sir William [Midsummer, 1532], "I went to
  Oxford, intending that my brother George and I should kill a buck with
  Sir Simon Harcourt, which he had promised me; and there at Oxford, in the
  said Jones's chamber, I did see certain stillatories, alembics, and other
  instruments of glass, and also a sceptre and other things, which he said
  did appertain to the conjuration of the four kings; and also an image of
  white <!-- Page 412 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page412"></a>[pg
  412]</span> metal; and in a box, a serpent's skin, as he said, and divers
  books and things, whereof one was a book which he said was my Lord
  Cardinal's, having pictures in it like angels. He told me he could make
  rings of gold, to obtain favour of great men; and said that my Lord
  Cardinal had such; and promised my said brother and me, either of us, one
  of them; and also he showed me a round thing like a ball of crystal.</p>

  <p>"He said that if the King's Grace went over to France [the Calais
  visit of October, 1532], his Grace should marry my Lady Marchioness of
  Pembroke before that his Highness returned again; and that it would be
  dangerous to his Grace, and to the most part of the noblemen that should
  go with him; saying also that he had written to one of the king's council
  to advise his Highness not to go over, for if he did, it should not be
  for his Grace's profit."</p>

  <p>The wizard next pretended that he had seen a vision of a certain room
  in a tower, in which a spirit had appeared with a coat of arms in his
  hand, and had "delivered the same to Sir William Neville." The arms being
  described as those of the Warwick family, Sir William, his brother, and
  Jones rode down from Oxford to Warwick, where they went over the castle.
  The wizard professed to recognise in a turret chamber the room in which
  he had seen the spirit, and he prophesied that Sir William should recover
  the earldom, the long-coveted prize of all the Neville family.</p>

  <p>On their return to Oxford, Jones, continues Sir William, said further,
  "That there should be a field in the north about a se'n-night before
  Christmas, in which my Lord my brother [Lord Latimer] should be slain;
  the realm should be long without a king; and much robbery would be within
  the realm, specially of abbeys and religious houses, and of rich men, as
  merchants, graziers, and others; so that, if I would, he at that time
  would advise me to find the means to enter into the said castle for mine
  own safeguard, and divers persons would resort unto me. <i>None of
  Cadwallader's blood</i>, he told me, <i>should reign more than
  twenty-four years;</i> and also that Prince Edward [son of Henry VI. and
  Margaret of Anjou, killed at Tewkesbury], had issue a son which was
  conveyed over sea; and there had issue a son which was yet alive, either
  in Saxony or Almayne; and that either he or the King of Scots should
  reign next after the King's Grace that now is. To all which I answered,"
  Sir William concluded, "that there is nothing which the will of God is
  that a man shall obtain, but that he of his goodness will put in his <!--
  Page 413 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page413"></a>[pg 413]</span>
  mind the way whereby he shall come by it; and that surely I had no mind
  to follow any such fashion; and that, also, the late Duke of Buckingham
  and others had cast themselves away by too much trust in prophecies, and
  other jeoparding of themselves, and therefore I would in no wise follow
  any such way. He answered, if I would not, it would be long ere I
  obtained it. Then I said I believed that well, and if it never came, I
  trusted to God to live well enough."<a name="NtA_664"></a><a
  href="#Nt_664"><sup>664</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sir George Neville confirmed generally his brother's story, protesting
  that they had never intended treason, and that "at no time had he been of
  counsel" when any treason was thought of.<a name="NtA_665"></a><a
  href="#Nt_665"><sup>665</sup></a></p>

  <p>The wizard himself was next sent for. The prophecies about the king he
  denied wholly. He admitted that he had seen an angel in a dream giving
  Sir William Neville the shield of the earldom in Warwick Castle, and that
  he had accompanied the two brothers to Warwick, to examine the tower.
  Beyond that, he said that he knew nothing either of them or of their
  intentions. He declared himself a good subject, and he would "jeopard his
  life" to make the philosopher's stone for the king in twelve months if
  the king pleased to command him. He desired "no longer space than twelve
  months upon silver and twelve and a half upon gold;" to be kept in prison
  till he had done it; and it would be "better to the King's Grace than a
  thousand men."<a name="NtA_666"></a><a
  href="#Nt_666"><sup>666</sup></a></p>

  <p>The result of these examinations does not appear, except it be that
  the Nevilles were dismissed without punishment; and the story itself may
  be thought too trifling to have deserved a grave notice. I see in it,
  however, an illustration very noticeworthy of the temper which was
  working in the country. The suspicion of treason in the Neville family
  may not have been confirmed, although we see them casting longing looks
  on the lost inheritance of Warwick; but their confessions betray the
  visions of impending change, anarchy, and confusion, which were haunting
  the popular imagination. A craving after prophecies, a restless eagerness
  to search into the future by abnormal means, had infected all ranks from
  the highest to the lowest; and such symptoms, when they appear, are a
  sure evidence of approaching disorder, for they are an evidence of a
  present madness which has brought down wisdom to a common level with
  folly. At such times, the idlest fancy is more potent <!-- Page 414
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page414"></a>[pg 414]</span> with the
  mind than the soundest arguments of reason. The understanding abdicates
  its functions; and men are given over, as if by magic, to the
  enchantments of insanity.</p>

  <p>Phenomena of this eccentric kind always accompany periods of
  intellectual change. Most men live and think by habit; and when habit
  fails them, they are like unskilful sailors who have lost the landmarks
  of their course, and have no compass and no celestial charts by which to
  steer. In the years which preceded the French Revolution, Cagliostro was
  the companion of princes&mdash;at the dissolution of paganism the
  practicers of curious arts, the watches and the necromancers, were the
  sole objects of reverence in the Roman world;&mdash;and so, before the
  Reformation, archbishops and cardinals saw an inspired prophetess in a
  Kentish servant girl; Oxford heads of colleges sought out heretics with
  the help of astrology; Anne Boleyn blessed a basin of rings, her royal
  fingers pouring such virtue into the metal that no disorder could resist
  it;<a name="NtA_667"></a><a href="#Nt_667"><sup>667</sup></a> Wolsey had
  a magic crystal; and Cromwell, while in Wolsey's household, "did haunt to
  the company of a wizard."<a name="NtA_668"></a><a
  href="#Nt_668"><sup>668</sup></a> These things were the counterpart of a
  religion which taught that slips of paper, duly paid for, could secure
  indemnity for sin. It was well for England that the chief captain at
  least was proof against the epidemic&mdash;no random scandal seems ever
  to have whispered that such delusions had touched the mind of the king.<a
  name="NtA_669"></a><a href="#Nt_669"><sup>669</sup></a></p>

  <p>While the government were prosecuting these inquiries at home, the law
  at the Vatican had run its course; November passed, and as no submission
  had arrived, the sentence of the 12th of July came into force, and the
  king, the queen, and the Archbishop of Canterbury were declared to have
  incurred the threatened censures.</p>

  <p>The privy council met on the 2nd of December, and it was determined in
  consequence that copies of the "Act of Appeals," and of the king's
  "provocation" to a general council, should be fixed without delay on
  every church door in England. Protests were at the same time to be drawn
  up and sent into Flanders, and to the other courts in Europe, "to the
  intent the falsehood and injustice of the Bishop of Rome might appear to
  all the world." The defences of the country were to be looked <!-- Page
  415 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page415"></a>[pg 415]</span> to;
  and "spies" to be sent into Scotland to see "what they intended there,"
  "and whether they would confeder themselves with any outward princes."
  Finally, it was proposed that the attempt to form an alliance with the
  Lutheran powers should be renewed on a larger scale; that certain
  discreet and grave persons should be appointed to conclude "some league
  or amity with the princes of Germany"&mdash;"that is to say, the King of
  Poland, the King of Hungary,<a name="NtA_670"></a><a
  href="#Nt_670"><sup>670</sup></a> the Duke of Saxony, the Duke of
  Bavaria, the Duke of Brandenburg, the Landgrave of Hesse, and other
  potentates."<a name="NtA_671"></a><a href="#Nt_671"><sup>671</sup></a>
  Vaughan's mission had been merely tentative, and had failed. Yet the
  offer of a league, offensive and defensive, the immediate and avowed
  object of which was a general council at which the Protestants should be
  represented, might easily succeed where vague offers of amity had come to
  nothing. The formation of a Protestant alliance, however, would have been
  equivalent to a declaration of war against Catholic Europe; and it was a
  step which could not be taken, consistently with the Treaty of
  Calais,&mdash;without first communicating with Francis.</p>

  <p>Henry, therefore, by the advice of the council, wrote a despatch to
  Sir John Wallop, the ambassador at Paris, which was to be laid before the
  French court. He explained the circumstances in which he was placed, with
  the suggestion which the council had made to him. He gave a list of the
  princes with whom he had been desired by his ministers to connect
  himself&mdash;and the object was nothing less than a coalition of
  Northern Europe. He recapitulated the injuries which he had received from
  the pope, who at length was studying "to subvert the rest and peace of
  the realm;" "yea, and so much as in him was, utterly to destroy the
  same." The nobles and council, he said, for their own sake as well as for
  the sake of the kingdom, had entreated him to put an end, once for all,
  to the pope's usurpation; and to invite the Protestant princes, for the
  universal weal of Christendom, to unite in a common alliance. In his
  present situation he was inclined to act upon this advice. "As concerning
  his own realm, he had already taken such order with his nobles and
  subjects, as he would shortly be able to give to the pope such a buffet
  as he never had heretofore;" but as a German alliance was a matter of
  <!-- Page 416 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page416"></a>[pg
  416]</span> great weight and importance, "although," he concluded, "we
  consider it to be right expedient to set forth the same with all
  diligence, yet we intend nothing to do therein without making our good
  brother first privy thereunto. And for this cause and consideration only,
  you may say that we have at this time addressed these letters unto you,
  commanding you to declare our said purpose unto our good brother, and to
  require of him on our behalf his good address and best advice. Of his
  answer we require you to advertise us with all diligence, for according
  thereunto we intend to attemper our proceedings. We have lately had
  advertisements how that our said good brother should, by the labour of
  divers affectionate Papists, be minded to set forth something with his
  clergy in advancement of the pope and his desires. This we cannot believe
  that he will do."<a name="NtA_672"></a><a
  href="#Nt_672"><sup>672</sup></a></p>

  <p>The meaning of this letter lies upon the surface. If the European
  powers were determined to leave him no alternative, the king was prepared
  to ally himself with the Lutherans. But however he might profess to
  desire that alliance, it was evident that he would prefer, if possible, a
  less extreme resource. The pope had ceased to be an object of concern to
  him; but he could not contemplate, without extreme unwillingness, a
  separation from the orderly governments who professed the Catholic faith.
  The pope had injured him; Francis had deceived him; they had tempted his
  patience because they knew his disposition. The limit of endurance had
  been reached at length; yet, on the verge of the concluding rupture, he
  turned once more, as if to offer a last opportunity of peace.</p>

  <p>The reply of Francis was an immediate mission of the Bishop of Bayonne
  (now Bishop of Paris), first into England, and from England to Rome,
  where he was to endeavour, to the best of his ability, to seam together
  the already gaping rent in the church with fair words&mdash;a hopeless
  task&mdash;the results of which, however, were unexpectedly considerable,
  as will be presently seen.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the side of Flanders, the atmosphere was dubious and
  menacing. The refugee friars, who were reported to be well supplied with
  money from England, were labouring to exasperate the people, Father Peto
  especially distinguishing himself upon this service.<a
  name="NtA_673"></a><a href="#Nt_673"><sup>673</sup></a> The English
  ambassador, Sir John <!-- Page 417 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page417"></a>[pg 417]</span> Hacket, still remained at Brussels,
  and the two governments were formally at peace; but when Hacket required
  the queen-regent to forbid the publication of the brief of July in the
  Netherlands, he was met with a positive refusal. "M. Ambassador," she
  said, "the Emperor, the King of Hungary, the Queen of France, the King of
  Portugal, and I, understand what are the rights of our aunt&mdash;our
  duty is to her&mdash;and such letters of the pope as come hither in her
  favour we shall obey. Your master has no right to complain either of the
  emperor or of myself, if we support our aunt in a just cause."<a
  name="NtA_674"></a><a href="#Nt_674"><sup>674</sup></a> At the same time,
  formal complaints were made by Charles of the personal treatment of Queen
  Catherine, and the clouds appeared to be gathering for a storm. Yet here,
  too, there was an evident shrinking from extremities. A Welsh gentleman
  had been at Brussels to offer his services against Henry, and had met
  with apparent coldness. Sir John Hacket wrote, on the 15th of December,
  that he was assured by well-informed persons, that so long as Charles
  lived, he would never be the first to begin a war with England, "which
  would rebound to the destruction of the Low Countries."<a
  name="NtA_675"></a><a href="#Nt_675"><sup>675</sup></a> A week later,
  when the queen-regent was suffering from an alarming illness, he said it
  was reported that, should she die, Catherine or Mary, if either of them
  was allowed to leave England, would be held "meet to have governance of
  the Low Countries."<a name="NtA_676"></a><a
  href="#Nt_676"><sup>676</sup></a> This was a generous step, if the
  emperor seriously contemplated it. The failure of the Nun of Kent had
  perhaps taught him that there was no present prospect of a successful
  insurrection. In his conduct towards England, he was seemingly governing
  himself by the prospect which might open for a successful attack upon it.
  If occasion offered to strike the government in connection with an
  efficient Catholic party in the nation itself, he would not fail to avail
  himself of it.<a name="NtA_677"></a><a href="#Nt_677"><sup>677</sup></a>
  Otherwise, he would perhaps content himself with an <!-- Page 418
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page418"></a>[pg 418]</span> attitude
  of inactive menace; unless menaced himself by a Protestant
  confederation.</p>

  <p>Amidst these uneasy symptoms at home and abroad, parliament
  re-assembled on the 15th of January. It was a changed England since these
  men first came together on the fall of Wolsey. Session after session had
  been spent in clipping the roots of the old tree which had overshadowed
  them for centuries. On their present meeting they were to finish their
  work, and lay it prostrate for ever. Negotiations were still pending with
  the See of Rome, and this momentous session had closed before the final
  catastrophe. The measures which were passed in the course of it are not,
  therefore, to be looked upon as adopted hastily, in a spirit of
  retaliation, but as the consistent accomplishment of a course which had
  been deliberately adopted, to reverse the positions of the civil and
  spiritual authority within the realm, and to withdraw the realm itself
  from all dependence on a foreign power.</p>

  <p>The Annates and Firstfruits' Bill had not yet received the royal
  assent; but the pope had refused to grant the bulls for bishops recently
  appointed, and he was no longer to receive payment for services which he
  refused to render. Peter's pence were still paid, and might continue to
  be paid, if the pope would recollect himself; but, like the Sibyl of
  Cuma, Henry destroyed some fresh privilege with each delay of justice,
  demanding the same price for the preservation of what remained. The
  secondary streams of tribute now only remained to the Roman See; and
  communion with the English church, which it was for Clement to accept or
  refuse.</p>

  <p>The circumstances under which the session opened were, however, grave
  and saddening. Simultaneously with the concluding legislation on the
  church, the succession to the throne was to be determined in terms which
  might, perhaps, be accepted as a declaration of war by the emperor; and
  the affair of the Nun of Kent had rendered necessary an inquiry into the
  conduct of honoured members of the two Houses, who were lying under the
  shadow of high treason. The conditions were for the first time to be
  plainly seen under which the Reformation was to fight its way. The road
  which lay before it was beset not merely with external obstacles, which a
  strong will and a strong hand could crush, but with the phantoms of dying
  faiths, which haunted the hearts of all living men; the superstitions,
  the prejudices, the hopes, the fears, the passions, which swayed stormily
  and fitfully through the minds of every actor in the great drama.</p>

<!-- Page 419 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page419"></a>[pg 419]</span>

  <p>The uniformity of action in the parliament of 1529, during the seven
  years which it continued, is due to the one man who saw his way
  distinctly, Thomas Cromwell. The nation was substantially united in the
  divorce question, could the divorce be secured without a rupture with the
  European powers. It was united also on the necessity of limiting the
  jurisdiction of the clergy, and cutting short the powers of the
  consistory courts. But in questions of "opinion" there was the most
  sensitive jealousy; and from the combined instincts of prejudice and
  conservatism, the majority of the country in a count of heads would
  undoubtedly have been against a separation from Rome.</p>

  <p>The clergy professed to approve the acts of the government, but it was
  for the most part with the unwilling acquiescence of men who were without
  courage to refuse. The king was divided against himself. Nine days in ten
  he was the clear-headed, energetic, powerful statesman; on the tenth he
  was looking wistfully to the superstition which he had left, and the
  clear sunshine was darkened with theological clouds, which broke in
  lightning and persecution. Thus there was danger at any moment of a
  reaction, unless opportunity was taken at the flood, unless the work was
  executed too completely to admit of reconsideration, and the nation
  committed to a course from which it was impossible to recede. The action
  of the conservatives was paralysed for the time by the want of a fixed
  purpose. The various parts of the movement were so skilfully linked
  together, that partial opposition to it was impossible; and so long as
  the people had to choose between the pope and the king, their loyalty
  would not allow them to hesitate. But very few men actively adhered to
  Cromwell. Cromwell had struck the line on which the forces of nature were
  truly moving&mdash;the resultant, not of the victory of either of the
  extreme parties, but of the joint action of their opposing forces. To him
  belonged the rare privilege of genius, to see what other men could not
  see; and therefore he was condemned to rule a generation which hated him,
  to do the will of God, and to perish in his success. He had no party. By
  the nobles he was regarded with the same mixed contempt and fear which
  had been felt for Wolsey. The Protestants, perhaps, knew what he was, but
  he could only purchase their toleration by himself checking their
  extravagance. Latimer was the only person of real power on whose
  friendship he could calculate, and Latimer was too plain spoken on
  dangerous questions to be useful as a political supporter.</p>

  <p>The session commenced on the 15th of January.</p>

<!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span>

  <p>The first step was to receive the final submission of convocation. The
  undignified resistance was at last over, and the clergy had promised to
  abstain for the future from unlicensed legislation. To secure their
  adherence to their engagements, an act<a name="NtA_678"></a><a
  href="#Nt_678"><sup>678</sup></a> was passed to make the breach of that
  engagement penal; and a commission of thirty-two persons, half of whom

  <p>The next most important movement was to assimilate the trials for
  heresy with the trials for other criminal offences. I have already
  explained at length the manner in which the bishops abused their judicial
  powers. These powers were not absolutely taken away, but ecclesiastics
  were no longer permitted to arrest <i>ex officio</i> and examine at their
  pleasure. Where a charge of heresy was to be brought against a man,
  presentments were to be made by lawful witnesses before justices of the
  peace; and then, and not otherwise, he might fall under the authority of
  the "ordinary." Secret examinations were declared illegal. The offender
  was to be tried in open court, and, previous to his trial, had a right to
  be admitted to bail, unless the bishop could show cause to the contrary
  to the satisfaction of two magistrates.<a name="NtA_680"></a><a
  href="#Nt_680"><sup>680</sup></a></p>

  <p>This was but a slight instalment of lenity; but it was an indication
  of the turning tide. Limited as it was, the act operated as an effective
  check upon persecution till the passing of the Six Articles Bill.</p>

  <p>Turning next to the relations between England and Rome, the parliament
  reviewed the Annates Act,<a name="NtA_681"></a><a
  href="#Nt_681"><sup>681</sup></a> which had been left unratified in the
  hope that the pope might have consented to a compromise, and that "by
  some gentle ways the said exaction might have been redressed and
  reformed." The expectation had been disappointed. The pope had not
  condescended to reply to the communication which had been made to him,
  and the act had in consequence received the royal assent. An alteration
  had thus become necessary in the manner of presentation to vacant
  bishoprics. The anomalies of the existing practice have been already
  described. By the Great Charter the chapters had acquired the right of
  free election. A <i>congé d'élire</i> was granted by the king on the
  occurrence of a vacancy, <!-- Page 421 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page421"></a>[pg 421]</span> with no attempt at a nomination. The
  chapters were supposed to make their choice freely, and the name of the
  bishop-elect was forwarded to the pope, who returned the Pallium and the
  Bulls, receiving the Annates in exchange. The pope's part in the matter
  was now terminated. No Annates would be sent any longer to Rome, and no
  Bulls would be returned from Rome. The appointments lay between the
  chapters and the crown; and it might have seemed, at first sight, as if
  it would have been sufficient to omit the reference to the papacy, and as
  if the remaining forms might continue as they were. The chapters,
  however, had virtually long ceased to elect freely; the crown had
  absorbed the entire functions of presentation, sometimes appointing
  foreigners,<a name="NtA_682"></a><a href="#Nt_682"><sup>682</sup></a>
  sometimes allowing the great ecclesiastical ministers to nominate
  themselves;<a name="NtA_683"></a><a href="#Nt_683"><sup>683</sup></a>
  while the rights of the chapters, though existing in theory, were not
  officially recognised either by the pope or by the crown. The king
  affected to accept the names of the prelates-elect, when returned to him
  from Rome, as nominations by the pope; and the pope, in communicating
  with the chapters, presented them with their bishops as from himself.<a
  name="NtA_684"></a><a href="#Nt_684"><sup>684</sup></a> The papal share
  in the matter was a shadow, but it was acknowledged under the forms of
  courtesy; the share of the chapters was wholly and absolutely ignored.
  The crisis of a revolution was not the moment at which their legal
  privileges could be safely restored to them. The problem of
  re-arrangement was a difficult one, and it was met in a manner peculiarly
  English. The practice of granting the <i>congé d'élire</i> to the
  chapters on the occurrence of a vacancy, which had fallen into desuetude,
  was again adopted, and the church resumed the forms of liberty: but the
  licence to elect a bishop was to be accompanied with the name of the
  person whom the chapter was required to elect; and if within twelve days
  the person so named <!-- Page 422 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page422"></a>[pg 422]</span> had not been chosen, the nomination of
  the crown was to become absolute, and the chapter would incur a
  Premunire.<a name="NtA_685"></a><a href="#Nt_685"><sup>685</sup></a></p>

  <p>This act, which I conceive to have been more arbitrary in form than in
  intention, was followed by a closing attack upon the remaining
  "exactions" of the Bishop of Rome. The Annates were gone. There were yet
  to go, "Pensions, Censes, Peter's Pence, Procurations, Fruits, Suits for
  Provision, Delegacies and Rescripts in causes of Contention and Appeals,
  Jurisdictions legatine&mdash;also Dispensations, Licenses, Faculties,
  Grants, Relaxations, Writs called Perinde valere, Rehabilitations,
  Abolitions," with other unnamed (the parliament being wearied of naming
  them) "infinite sorts of Rules, Briefs, and instruments of sundry
  natures, names, and kinds." All these were perennially open sluices,
  which had drained England of its wealth for centuries, returning only in
  showers of paper, and the Commons were determined that streams so
  unremunerative should flow no longer. They conceived that they had been
  all along imposed upon, and that the "Bishop of Rome was to be blamed for
  having allured and beguiled the English nation, persuading them that he
  had power to dispense with human laws, uses, and customs, contrary to
  right and conscience." If the king so pleased, therefore, they would not
  be so beguiled any more. These and all similar exactions should cease;
  and all powers claimed by the Bishop of Rome within the realm <!-- Page
  423 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page423"></a>[pg 423]</span> should
  cease, and should be transferred to the crown. At the same time they
  would not press upon the pope too hardly; they would repeat the same
  conditions which they had offered with the Annates. He had received these
  revenues as the supreme judge in the highest court in Europe, and he
  might retain his revenues or receive compensation for them, if he dared
  to be just. It was for himself to resolve, and three months were allowed
  for a final decision.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the Commons thought it well to assert that they were
  separating, not from the church of Christ, but only from the papacy. A
  judge who allowed himself to be overawed against his conscience by a
  secular power, could not any longer be recognised; but no thing or things
  contained in the act should be afterwards "interpreted or expounded, that
  his Grace (the king), his nobles and subjects, intended by the same to
  decline or vary from the congregation of Christ's church in anything
  concerning the articles of the Catholic faith of Christendom, or in any
  other things declared by the Holy Scripture and the Word of God necessary
  for salvation; but only to make an ordinance, by policies necessary and
  convenient, to repress vice, and for the good conservation of the realm
  in peace, unity, and tranquillity, from ravin and spoil&mdash;ensuing
  much the old antient customs of the realm in that behalf."<a
  name="NtA_686"></a><a href="#Nt_686"><sup>686</sup></a></p>

  <p>The most arduous business was thus finished&mdash;the most painful
  remained. The Nun of Kent and her accomplices were to be proceeded
  against by act of parliament; and the bill of their attainder was
  presented for the first time in the House of Lords, on the 18th of
  February. The offence of the principal conspirators was plainly high
  treason; their own confessions removed uncertainty; the guilt was
  clear&mdash;the sentence was inevitable. But the fault of those who had
  been listeners only was less easy of measurement, and might vary from
  comparative innocence to a definite breach of allegiance.</p>

  <p>The government were unwilling to press with severity on the noble
  lords and ladies whose names had been unexpectedly brought to light; and
  there were two men of high rank only, whose complicity it was thought
  necessary to notice. The Bishop of Rochester's connection with the Nun
  had been culpably encouraging; and the responsibility of Sir Thomas More
  was held also to be very great in having countenanced, however lightly,
  such perilous schemers.</p>

  <p>In the bill, therefore, as it was first read, More and Fisher <!--
  Page 424 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page424"></a>[pg 424]</span>
  found themselves declared guilty of misprision of treason. But the object
  of this measure was rather to warn than to punish, nor was there any real
  intention of continuing their prosecution. Cromwell, under instructions
  from the king, had communicated privately with both of them. He had sent
  a message to Fisher through his brother, telling him that he had only to
  ask for forgiveness to receive it;<a name="NtA_687"></a><a
  href="#Nt_687"><sup>687</sup></a> and he had begged More through his
  son-in-law, Mr. Roper, to furnish him with an explicit account of what
  had passed at any time between himself and the Nun,<a
  name="NtA_688"></a><a href="#Nt_688"><sup>688</sup></a> with an
  intimation that, if honestly made, it would be accepted in his
  favour.</p>

  <p>These advances were met by More in the spirit in which they were
  offered. He heartily thanked Cromwell, "reckoning himself right deeply
  beholden to him;"<a name="NtA_689"></a><a
  href="#Nt_689"><sup>689</sup></a> and replied with a long, minute, and
  evidently veracious story, detailing an interview which he had held with
  the woman in the chapel of Sion Monastery. He sent at the same time a
  copy of a letter which he had written to her, and described various
  conversations with the friars who were concerned in the forgery. He did
  not deny that he had believed the Nun to have been inspired, or that he
  had heard of the language which she was in the habit of using respecting
  the king. He protested, however, that he had himself never entertained a
  treasonable thought. He told Cromwell that "he had done a very
  meritorious deed in bringing forth to light such detestable hypocrisy,
  whereby every other wretch might take warning, and be feared to set forth
  their devilish dissembled falsehoods under the manner and colour of the
  wonderful work of God."<a name="NtA_690"></a><a
  href="#Nt_690"><sup>690</sup></a> More's offence had not been great. His
  acknowledgments were open and unreserved; and Cromwell laid his letter
  before the king, adding his own intercession that the matter might be
  passed over. Henry consented, expressing only his grief and concern that
  Sir Thomas More should have acted so unwisely.<a name="NtA_691"></a><a
  href="#Nt_691"><sup>691</sup></a> He required, nevertheless, as Cromwell
  suggested, that a formal letter should be written, with a confession of
  fault, and a request for forgiveness. More obeyed; he wrote, gracefully
  reminding the king of a promise <!-- Page 425 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page425"></a>[pg 425]</span> when he resigned the chancellorship,
  that in any suit which he might afterwards have to his Grace, either
  touching his honour or his profit, he should find his Highness his good
  and gracious lord.<a name="NtA_692"></a><a
  href="#Nt_692"><sup>692</sup></a> Henry acknowledged his claim; his name
  was struck out of the bill, and the prosecution against him was
  dropped.</p>

  <p>Fisher's conduct was very different; his fault had been far greater
  than More's, and promises more explicit had been held out to him of
  forgiveness. He replied to these promises by an elaborate and ridiculous
  defence&mdash;not writing to the king, as Cromwell desired him, but
  vindicating himself as having committed no fault; although he had
  listened eagerly to language which was only pardonable on the assumption
  that it was inspired, and had encouraged a nest of fanatics by his
  childish credulity. The Nun "had showed him not," he said, "that any
  prince or temporal lord should put the king in danger of his crown." He
  knew nothing of the intended insurrection. He believed the woman to have
  been a saint; he supposed that she had herself told the king all which
  she had told to him; and therefore he said that he had nothing for which
  to reproach himself.<a name="NtA_693"></a><a
  href="#Nt_693"><sup>693</sup></a> He was unable to see that the exposure
  of the imposture had imparted a fresh character to his conduct, which he
  was bound to regret. Knowingly or unknowingly, he had lent his
  countenance to a conspiracy; and so long as he refused to acknowledge his
  indiscretion, the government necessarily would interpret his actions in
  the manner least to his advantage.</p>

  <p>If he desired that his conduct should be forgotten, it was
  indispensable that he should change his attitude, and so Cromwell warned
  him. "Ye desire," the latter wrote, "for the passion of Christ, that ye
  be no more quickened in this matter; for if ye be put to that strait ye
  will not lose your soul, but ye will speak as your conscience leadeth
  you; with many more words of great courage. My Lord, if ye had taken my
  counsel sent unto you by your brother, and followed the same, submitting
  yourself by your letter to the King's Grace for your offences in this
  behalf, I would have trusted that ye should never be quickened in the
  matter more. But now where ye take upon you to defy the whole matter as
  ye were in no default, I cannot so far promise you. Wherefore, my Lord, I
  would eftsoons advise you that, laying apart all such excuses as ye have
  alleged in your letters, which in my opinion be of small <!-- Page 426
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page426"></a>[pg 426]</span> effect, ye
  beseech the King's Grace to be your gracious lord and to remit unto you
  your negligence, oversight, and offence committed against his Highness in
  this behalf; and I dare undertake that his Highness shall benignly accept
  you into his gracious favour, all matter of displeasure past afore this
  time forgotten and forgiven."<a name="NtA_694"></a><a
  href="#Nt_694"><sup>694</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fisher must have been a hopelessly impracticable person. Instead of
  following More's example, and accepting well-meant advice, he persisted
  in the same tone, and drew up an address to the House of Lords, in which
  he repeated the defence which he had made to Cromwell. He expressed no
  sorrow that he had been engaged in a criminal intrigue, no pleasure that
  the intrigue had been discovered; and he doggedly adhered to his
  assertions of his own innocence.<a name="NtA_695"></a><a
  href="#Nt_695"><sup>695</sup></a></p>

  <p>There was nothing to be done except to proceed with his attainder. The
  bill passed three readings, and the various prisoners were summoned to
  the Star Chamber to be heard in arrest of judgment. The Bishop of
  Rochester's attendance was dispensed with on the ground of illness, and
  because he had made his defence in writing.<a name="NtA_696"></a><a
  href="#Nt_696"><sup>696</sup></a> Nothing of consequence was urged by
  either of the accused. The bill was most explicit in its details, going
  carefully through the history of the imposture, and dwelling on the
  separate acts of each offender. They were able to disprove no one of its
  clauses, and on the 12th of March it was read a last time. On the 21st it
  received the royal assent, and there remained only to execute the
  sentence. The Nun herself, Richard Masters, and the five friars being
  found guilty of high treason, were to die; the Bishop of Rochester,
  Father Abel, Queen Catherine's confessor, and four more, were sentenced
  for misprision of treason to forfeiture of goods and imprisonment. All
  other persons implicated whose names did not appear, were declared
  pardoned at the intercession of Queen Anne.<a name="NtA_697"></a><a
  href="#Nt_697"><sup>697</sup></a></p>

  <p>The chief offenders suffered at Tyburn on the 21st of April, meeting
  death calmly, as it appears; receiving a fate most necessary and most
  deserved,<a name="NtA_698"></a><a href="#Nt_698"><sup>698</sup></a> yet
  claiming from us that partial <!-- Page 427 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page427"></a>[pg 427]</span> respect which is due to all persons
  who will risk their lives in an unselfish cause. For the Nun herself, we
  may feel even a less qualified regret. Before her death she was permitted
  to speak a few words to the people, which at the distance of three
  centuries will not be read without emotion.</p>

  <p>"Hither am I come to die," she said, "and I have not been the only
  cause of mine own death, which most justly I have deserved; but also I am
  the cause of the death of all these persons which at this time here
  suffer. And yet I am not so much to be blamed, considering that it was
  well known unto these learned men that I was a poor wench without
  learning; and therefore they might have easily perceived that the things
  which were done by me could not proceed in no such sort; but their
  capacities and learning could right well judge that they were altogether
  feigned. But because the things which I feigned were profitable unto
  them, therefore they much praised me, and bare me in hand that it was the
  Holy Ghost and not I that did them. And I being puffed up with their
  praises, fell into a pride and foolish fantasye with myself, and thought
  I might feign what I would, which thing hath brought me to this case, and
  for the which I now cry God and the King's Highness most heartily mercy,
  and desire all you good people to pray to God to have mercy on me, and on
  all them that here suffer with me."<a name="NtA_699"></a><a
  href="#Nt_699"><sup>699</sup></a></p>

  <p>And now the closing seal was to be affixed to the agitation of the
  great question of the preceding years. I have said that throughout these
  years the uncertainty of the succession had been the continual anxiety of
  the nation. The birth of a prince or princess could alone provide an
  absolute security; and to beget a prince appeared to be the single feat
  which Henry was unable to accomplish. The marriage so dearly bought had
  been followed as yet only by a girl; and if the king were to die, <!--
  Page 428 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page428"></a>[pg 428]</span>
  leaving two daughters circumstanced as Mary and Elizabeth were
  circumstanced, a dispute would open which the sword only could decide. To
  escape the certainty of civil war, therefore, it was necessary to lay
  down the line of inheritance by a peremptory order; to cut off resolutely
  all rival claims; and in legislating upon a matter so vital, and hitherto
  so uncertain and indeterminate, to enforce the decision with the most
  stringent and exacting penalties. From the Heptarchy downwards English
  history furnished no fixed rule of inheritance, but only a series of
  precedents of uncertainty; and while at no previous time had the
  circumstances of the succession been of a nature so legitimately
  embarrassing, the relations of England with the pope and with foreign
  powers doubly enhanced the danger. But I will not use my own language on
  so important a subject. The preamble of the Act of Succession is the best
  interpreter of the provisions of that act.</p>

  <p>"In their most humble wise show unto your Majesty your most humble and
  obedient subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons, in
  this present parliament assembled; that since it is the natural
  inclination of every man gladly and willingly to provide for the safety
  of both his title and succession, although it touch only his private
  cause; we therefore, most rightful and dreadful Sovereign Lord, reckon
  ourselves much more bounden to beseech and intreat your Highness
  (although we doubt not of your princely heart and wisdom, mixed with a
  natural affection to the same) to foresee and provide for the most
  perfect surety of both you and of your most lawful successors and heirs,
  upon which dependeth all our joy and wealth; in whom also is united and
  knit the only mere true inheritance and title of this realm without any
  contradiction. We, your said most humble and obedient servants, call to
  our remembrance the great divisions which in times past hath been in this
  realm by reason of several titles pretended to the imperial crown of the
  same; which some time and for the most part ensued by occasion of
  ambiguity, and [by] doubts then not so perfectly declared but that men
  might upon froward intents expound them to every man's sinister appetite
  and affection after their senses; whereof hath ensued great destruction
  and effusion of man's blood, as well of a great number of the nobles as
  of other the subjects and specialty inheritors in the same. The greatest
  occasion thereof hath been because no perfect and substantial provision
  by law hath been made within this realm itself when doubts and questions
  have been moved; <!-- Page 429 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page429"></a>[pg 429]</span> by reason whereof the Bishops of Rome
  and See Apostolic have presumed in times past to invest who should please
  them to inherit in other men's kingdoms and dominions, which thing we
  your most humble subjects, both spiritual and temporal, do much abhor and
  detest. And sometimes other foreign princes and potentates of sundry
  degrees, minding rather dissension and discord to continue in the realm
  than charity, equity, or unity, have many times supported wrong titles,
  whereby they might the more easily and facilly aspire to the superiority
  of the same.</p>

  <p>"The continuance and sufferance of these things, deeply considered and
  pondered, is too dangerous and perilous to be suffered any longer; and
  too much contrary to unity, peace, and tranquillity, being greatly
  reproachable and dishonourable to the whole realm. And in consideration
  thereof, your said subjects, calling further to their remembrance, that
  the good unity, peace, and wealth of the realm, specially and
  principally, above all worldly things, consisteth in the surety and
  certainty of the procreation and posterity of your Highness, in whose
  most Royal person at this time is no manner of doubt, do therefore most
  humbly beseech your Highness that it may be enacted, with the consent of
  the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this present
  parliament assembled&mdash;</p>

  <p>"1. That the marriage between your Highness and the Lady Catherine,
  widow of the late Prince Arthur, be declared to have been from the
  beginning, null, the issue of it illegitimate, and the separation
  pronounced by the Archbishop of Canterbury good and valid.</p>

  <p>"2. That the marriage between your Highness and your most dear and
  entirely beloved wife, Queen Anne, be established and held good, and
  taken for undoubtful, true, sincere, and perfect, ever hereafter."<a
  name="NtA_701"></a><a href="#Nt_701"><sup>701</sup></a></p>

  <p>The act then assumed a general character, laying down a table of
  prohibited degrees, within which marriage might not under any pretence be
  in future contracted; and demanding that any marriage which might already
  exist within those degrees should be at once dissolved. After this
  provision, it again returned to the king, and fixed the order in which
  his children by Queen Anne were to succeed. The details of the
  regulations were minute and elaborate, and the rule to be observed was
  the same as that which exists at present. First, the sons were to succeed
  <!-- Page 430 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>[pg
  430]</span> with their heirs. If sons failed, then the daughters, with
  their heirs; and, in conclusion, it was resolved that any person who
  should maliciously do anything by writing, printing, or other external
  act or deed to the peril of the king, or to the prejudice of his marriage
  with Queen Anne, or to the derogation of the issue of that marriage,
  should be held guilty of high treason; and whoever should speak against
  that marriage, should be held guilty of misprision of
  treason&mdash;severe enactments, such as could not be justified at
  ordinary times, and such as, if the times had been ordinary, would not
  have been thought necessary&mdash;but the exigencies of the country could
  not tolerate an uncertainty of title in the heir to the crown; and the
  title could only be secured by prohibiting absolutely the discussion of
  dangerous questions.</p>

  <p>The mere enactment of a statute, whatever penalties were attached to
  the violation of it, was still, however, an insufficient safeguard. The
  recent investigation had revealed a spirit of disloyalty, where such a
  spirit had not been expected. The deeper the inquiry had penetrated, the
  more clearly appeared tokens, if not of conspiracy, yet of excitement, of
  doubt, of agitation, of alienated feeling, if not of alienated act. All
  the symptoms were abroad which provide disaffection with its opportunity;
  and in the natural confusion which attended the revolt from the papacy,
  the obligations of duty, both political and religious, had become
  indefinite and contradictory, pointing in all directions, like the
  magnetic needle in a thunderstorm.</p>

  <p>It was thought well, therefore, to vest a power in the crown, of
  trying the tempers of suspected persons, and examining them upon oath, as
  to their willingness to maintain the decision of parliament. This measure
  was a natural corollary of the statute, and depended for its
  justification on the extent of the danger to which the state was exposed.
  If a difference of opinion on the legitimacy of the king's children, or
  of the pope's power in England, was not dangerous, it was unjust to
  interfere with the natural liberty of speech or thought. If it was
  dangerous, and if the state had cause for supposing that opinions of the
  kind might spread in secret so long as no opportunity was offered for
  detecting their progress, to require the oath was a measure of reasonable
  self-defence, not permissible only, but in a high degree necessary and
  right.</p>

  <p>Under the impression, then, that the circumstances of the country
  demanded extraordinary precautions, a commission was appointed,
  consisting of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord <!-- Page 431
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page431"></a>[pg 431]</span>
  Chancellor, the Duke of Norfolk, and the Duke of Suffolk; and these four,
  or any three of them, were empowered to administer, at the pleasure of
  the king, "to all and singular liege subjects of the realm," the
  following oath:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ye shall swear to bear your faith, truth, and obedience only to the
  King's Majesty, and to the heirs of his body, according to the limitation
  and rehearsal within the statute of succession; and not to any other
  within this realm, or foreign authority, prince, or potentate: and in
  case any oath be made or hath been made by you to any other person or
  persons, that then you do repute the same as vain and annihilate: and
  that to your cunning, wit, and utmost of your power, without guile,
  fraud, or other undue means, ye shall observe, keep, maintain, and defend
  this act above specified, and all the whole contents and effects thereof;
  and all other acts and statutes made since the beginning of this present
  parliament, in confirmation or for due execution of the same, or of
  anything therein contained. And thus ye shall do against all manner of
  persons, of what estate, dignity, degree, or condition soever they be;
  and in no wise do or attempt, or to your power suffer to be done or
  attempted, directly or indirectly, any thing or things, privily or
  apertly, to the let, hindrance, damage, or derogation thereof, by any
  manner of means, or for any pretence or cause, so help you God and all
  saints."<a name="NtA_702"></a><a href="#Nt_702"><sup>702</sup></a></p>

  <p>With this last resolution the House rose, having sat seventy-five
  days, and despatched their business swiftly. A week later, the news
  arrived from Rome that there too all was at length over; that the cause
  was decided, and decided against the king. The history of the closing
  catastrophe is as obscure as it is strange, and the account of the manner
  in which it was brought about is unfortunately incomplete in many
  important particulars. The outline only can be apprehended, and that very
  imperfectly.</p>

<!-- Page 432 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page432"></a>[pg 432]</span>

  <p>On the receipt in Paris of the letter in which Henry threatened to
  organise a Protestant confederacy, Du Bellay, in genuine anxiety for the
  welfare of Christendom, had volunteered his services for a final effort.
  Not a moment was to be lost, for the courts of Rome were already busy
  with the great cause; but the king's evident reluctance to break with the
  Catholic powers, gave room for hope that something might still be done;
  and going in person to England, the bishop had induced Henry, at the last
  extremity, either to entrust him with representative powers, or else to
  allow him after all to make some kind of concession. I am unable to learn
  the extent to which Henry yielded, but that an offer was made of some
  kind is evident from the form of the story.<a name="NtA_703"></a><a
  href="#Nt_703"><sup>703</sup></a> The winter was very cold, but the
  bishop made his way to Rome with the haste of good will, and arrived in
  time to stay judgment, which was on the point of being pronounced. It
  seemed, for the moment, as if he would succeed. He was permitted to make
  engagements on the part of Henry; and that time might be allowed for
  communication with England, the pope agreed to delay sentence till the
  23rd of March. This bishop's terms were approved by the king, and a
  courier was sent off with letters of confirmation; Sir Edward Karne and
  Dr. Revett following leisurely, with a more ample commission. The stone
  which had been laboriously rolled to the summit of the hill was trembling
  on the brink, and in a moment might rebound into the plain.</p>

  <p>But this was not to be the end. Some accidental cause delayed the
  courier; the 23rd of March came, and he had not arrived. Du Bellay
  implored a further respite. The King of England, he said, had waited six
  years; it was not a great thing for the papal council to wait six days.
  The cardinals were divided; but the Spanish party were the strongest, and
  when the votes were taken carried the day. The die was cast, and the
  pope, in spite of himself, his promises, and his conscience, drove at
  length upon the rocks to which he had been so long drifting.<a
  name="NtA_704"></a><a href="#Nt_704"><sup>704</sup></a> In deference to
  the opinion of the majority of the cardinals, he pronounced the original
  marriage to have been valid, the dispensation <!-- Page 433 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page433"></a>[pg 433]</span> by which it was
  permitted to have been legal; and, as a natural consequence, Henry, King
  of England, should he fail in obedience to this judgment, was declared to
  be excommunicate from the fellowship of the church, and to have forfeited
  the allegiance of his subjects.</p>

  <p>Lest the censures should be discredited by a blank discharge,
  engagements were entered into, that within four months of the
  promulgation of the sentence, the emperor would invade England, and Henry
  should be deposed.<a name="NtA_705"></a><a
  href="#Nt_705"><sup>705</sup></a> The imperialists illuminated Rome;
  cannon were fired; bonfires blazed; and great bodies of men paraded the
  streets with shouts of "the Empire and Spain."<a name="NtA_706"></a><a
  href="#Nt_706"><sup>706</sup></a> Already, in their eager expectation,
  England was a second Netherlands, a captured province under the regency
  of Catherine or Mary.</p>

  <p>Two days later, the courier arrived. The pope, at the entreaties of
  the Bishop of Paris, re-assembled the consistory, to consider whether the
  steps which had been taken should be undone. They sat debating all night,
  and the result was nothing. No dependence could be placed on the
  cardinals, Du Bellay said, for they spoke one way, and voted another.<a
  name="NtA_707"></a><a href="#Nt_707"><sup>707</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus all was over. In a scene of general helplessness the long drama
  closed, and, what we call accident, for want of some better word, cut the
  knot at last over which human incapacity had so vainly laboured. The
  Bishop of Paris retired from Rome in despair. On his way back, he met the
  English commissioners at Bologna, and told them that their errand was
  hopeless, and that they need not proceed. "When we asked him," wrote Sir
  Edward Karne to the king, "the cause of such hasty process, he made
  answer that the imperialists at Rome had strengthened themselves in such
  a manner, that they coacted the said Bishop of Rome to give sentence
  contrary to his own mind, and the expectation of himself and of the
  French king. He showed us also that the Lady Princess Dowager sent
  lately, in the month of March past, letters to the Bishop of Rome, and
  also to her proctors, whereby the Bishop of Rome was much moved for her
  part. The imperials, before the sentence was given, promised, in the
  emperor's behalf, that he would be the executor of the sentence."<a
  name="NtA_708"></a><a href="#Nt_708"><sup>708</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page 434 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page434"></a>[pg 434]</span>

  <p>This is all which we are able to say of the immediate catastrophe
  which decided the fate of England, and through England, of the world. The
  deep impenetrable falsehood of the Roman ecclesiastics prevents us from
  discovering with what intentions the game of the last few weeks or months
  had been played; it is sufficient for Englishmen to remember that,
  whatever may have been the explanation of his conduct, the pope, in the
  concluding passage of his connection with this country, furnished the
  most signal justification which was ever given for the revolt from an
  abused authority. The supreme judge in Christendom had for six years
  trifled with justice, out of fear of an earthly prince; he concluded
  these years with uniting the extreme of folly with the extreme of
  improbity, and pronounced a sentence, willingly or unwillingly, which he
  had acknowledged to be unjust.</p>

  <p>Charity may possibly acquit Clement of conscious duplicity. He was one
  of those men who waited upon fortune, and waited always without success;
  who gave his word as the interest of the moment suggested, trusting that
  it might be convenient to observe it; and who was too long accustomed to
  break his promises to look with any particular alarm on that contingency.
  It is possible, also,&mdash;for of this Clement was capable&mdash;that he
  knew from the beginning the conclusion to which he would at last be
  driven; that he had engaged himself with Charles to decide in Catherine's
  favour as distinctly as he had engaged himself with Francis to decide
  against her; and that all his tortuous scheming was intended either to
  weary out the patience of the King of England, or to entangle him in
  acknowledgments from which he would not be able to extricate himself.</p>

  <p>He was mistaken, certainly, in the temper of the English nation; he
  believed what the friars told him; and trusting to the promises of
  disaffection, insurrection, invasion&mdash;those <i>ignes fatui</i> which
  for sixty years floated so delusively before the Italian imagination, he
  imagined, perhaps, that he might trifle with Henry with impunity. This
  only is impossible, that, if he had seriously intended to fulfil the
  promises which he had made to the French king, the accidental delay of a
  courier could have made so large a difference in his determination. It is
  not possible that, if he had assured himself, as he pretended, that
  justice was on the side against which he had declared, he would not have
  availed himself of any pretext to retreat from a position which ought to
  have been intolerable to him.</p>

  <p>The question, however, had ended, "as all things in this <!-- Page 435
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page435"></a>[pg 435]</span> world do
  have their end." The news of the sentence arrived in England at the
  beginning of April, with an intimation of the engagements which had been
  entered upon by the imperial ambassador for an invasion. Du Bellay
  returned to Paris at the same time, to report the failure of his
  undertaking; and Francis, disappointed, angry, and alarmed, sent the Duke
  of Guise to London with promises of support if an attempt to invade was
  really made, and with a warning at the same time to Henry to prepare for
  danger. Troops were gathering in Flanders; detachments were on their way
  out of Italy, Germany, and Bohemia, to be followed by three thousand
  Spaniards, and perhaps many more; and the object avowed for these
  preparations was wholly incommensurate with their magnitude.<a
  name="NtA_709"></a><a href="#Nt_709"><sup>709</sup></a> For his own sake
  Francis could not permit a successful invasion of England, unless,
  indeed, he himself was to take part in it; and therefore, with entire
  sincerity, he offered his services. The cordial understanding for which
  Henry had hoped was at an end; but the political confederacy remained,
  which the interests of the two countries combined for the present to
  preserve unbroken.</p>

  <p>Guise proposed another interview at Calais between the sovereigns. The
  king for the moment was afraid to leave England,<a name="NtA_710"></a><a
  href="#Nt_710"><sup>710</sup></a> lest the opportunity should be made use
  of for an insurrection; but prudence taught him, though disappointed in
  Francis, to make the best of a connection too convenient to be
  sacrificed. The German league was left in abeyance till the immediate
  danger was passed, and till the effect of the shock in England itself had
  been first experienced. He gladly accepted, in lieu of it, an offer that
  the French fleet should guard the Channel through the summer; and
  meanwhile, he collected himself resolutely, to abide the issue, whatever
  the issue was to be.</p>

  <p>The Tudor spirit was at length awake in the English sovereign. He had
  exhausted the resources of patience; he had stooped even to indignity to
  avoid the conclusion which had come at last. There was nothing left but
  to meet defiance by defiance, and accept the position to which the pope
  had driven <!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page436"></a>[pg 436]</span> him. In quiet times occasionally
  wayward and capricious, Henry, like Elizabeth after him, reserved his
  noblest nature for the moment of danger, and was ever greatest when peril
  was most immediate. Woe to those who crossed him now, for the time was
  grown stern, and to trifle further was to be lost. The suspended act of
  parliament was made law on the day (it would seem) of the arrival of the
  sentence. Convocation, which was still sitting, hurried through a
  declaration that the pope had no more power in England than any other
  bishop.<a name="NtA_711"></a><a href="#Nt_711"><sup>711</sup></a> Five
  years before, if a heretic had ventured so desperate an opinion, the
  clergy would have shut their ears and run upon him: now they only
  contended with each other in precipitate obsequiousness. The houses of
  the Observants at Canterbury and Greenwich, which had been implicated
  with the Nun of Kent, were suppressed, and the brethren were scattered
  among monasteries where they could be under surveillance. The Nun and her
  friends were sent to execution.<a name="NtA_712"></a><a
  href="#Nt_712"><sup>712</sup></a> The ordnance stores were examined, the
  repairs of the navy were hastened, and the garrisons were strengthened
  along the coast. Everywhere the realm armed itself for the struggle,
  looking well to the joints of its harness and to the temper of its
  weapons.</p>

  <p>The commission appointed under the Statute of Succession opened its
  sittings to receive the oaths of allegiance. Now, more than ever, was it
  necessary to try men's dispositions, when the pope had challenged their
  obedience. In words all went well: the peers swore; bishops, abbots,
  priors, heads of colleges swore<a name="NtA_713"></a><a
  href="#Nt_713"><sup>713</sup></a> with scarcely an exception,&mdash;the
  nation seemed to unite in an unanimous declaration of freedom. In one
  quarter only, and that a very painful one, was there refusal. It was
  found solely among the persons who had been implicated in the late
  conspiracy. Neither Sir Thomas More nor the Bishop of Rochester could
  expect that their recent conduct would exempt them from an obligation
  which the people generally accepted with good will. They had connected
  themselves, perhaps unintentionally, with a body of confessed traitors.
  An opportunity was offered them of giving evidence of their loyalty, and
  escaping from the shadow of distrust. More had been treated leniently;
  Fisher had been treated far more than leniently. It <!-- Page 437
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page437"></a>[pg 437]</span> was both
  fair and natural that they should be called upon to give proof that their
  lesson had not been learnt in vain; and, in fact, no other persons, if
  they had been passed over, could have been called upon to swear, for no
  other persons had laid themselves open to so just suspicion.</p>

  <p>Their conduct so exactly tallied, that they must have agreed
  beforehand on the course which they would adopt; and in following the
  details, we need concern ourselves only with the nobler figure.</p>

  <p>The commissioners sate at the archbishop's palace at Lambeth; and at
  the end of April, Sir Thomas More received a summons to appear before
  them.<a name="NtA_714"></a><a href="#Nt_714"><sup>714</sup></a> He was at
  his house at Chelsea, where for the last two years he had lived in deep
  retirement, making ready for evil times. Those times at length were come.
  On the morning on which he was to present himself, he confessed and
  received the sacrament in Chelsea church; and "whereas," says his
  great-grandson, "at other times, before he parted from his wife and
  children, they used to bring him to his boat, and he there kissing them
  bade them farewell, at this time he suffered none of them to follow him
  forth of his gate, but pulled the wicket after him, and with a heavy
  heart he took boat with his son Roper."<a name="NtA_715"></a><a
  href="#Nt_715"><sup>715</sup></a> He was leaving his home for the last
  time, and he knew it. He sat silent for some minutes, and then, with a
  sudden start, said, "I thank our Lord, the field is won." Lambeth Palace
  was crowded with people who had come on the same errand with himself.
  More was called in early, and found Cromwell present with the four
  commissioners, and also the Abbot of Westminster. The oath was read to
  him. It implied that he should keep the statute of succession in all its
  parts, and he desired to see the statute itself. He read it through, and
  at once replied that others might do as they pleased; he would blame no
  one for taking the oath; but for himself it was impossible. He would
  swear willingly to the part of it which secured the succession to the
  children of Queen Anne.<a name="NtA_716"></a><a
  href="#Nt_716"><sup>716</sup></a> That was a matter on which parliament
  was competent to decide, and he had no right to make objections. If he
  might <!-- Page 438 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page438"></a>[pg
  438]</span> be allowed to take an oath to this portion of the statute in
  language of his own, he would do it; but as the words stood, he would
  "peril his soul" by using them. The Lord Chancellor desired him to
  re-consider his answer. He retired to the garden, and in his absence
  others were called in; among them the Bishop of Rochester, who refused in
  the same terms. More was then recalled. He was asked if he persisted in
  his resolution; and when he replied that he did, he was requested to
  state his reasons. He said that he was afraid of increasing the king's
  displeasure, but if he could be assured that he might explain himself
  safely he was ready to do so. If his objection could then be answered to
  his satisfaction, he would swear; in the meantime, he repeated, very
  explicitly, that he judged no one&mdash;he spoke only for himself.</p>

  <p>An opening seemed to be offered in these expressions which was caught
  at by Cranmer's kind-hearted casuistry. If Sir Thomas More could not
  condemn others for taking the oath, the archbishop said, Sir Thomas More
  could not be sure that it was sin to take it; while his duty to his king
  and to the parliament was open and unquestioned.</p>

  <p>More hesitated for an instant, but he speedily recovered his firmness.
  He had considered what he ought to do, he said; his conscience was clear
  about it, and he could say no more than he had said already. They
  continued to argue with him, but without effect; he had made up his mind;
  the victory, as he said, had been won.</p>

  <p>Cromwell was deeply affected. In his passionate regret, he exclaimed,
  that he had rather his only son had lost his head than that More should
  have refused the oath. No one knew better than Cromwell that intercession
  would be of no further use; that he could not himself advise the king to
  give way. The parliament, after grave consideration, had passed a law
  which they held necessary to secure the peace of the country; and two
  persons of high rank refused obedience to it, whose example would tell in
  every English household. Either, therefore, the act was not worth the
  parchment on which it was written, or the penalties of it must be
  enforced: no middle way, no compromise, no acquiescent reservations,
  could in such a case be admitted. The law must have its way.</p>

  <p>The recusants were committed for four days to the keeping of the Abbot
  of Westminster; and the council met to determine on the course to be
  pursued. Their offence, by the act, was misprision of treason. On the
  other hand, they had both offered <!-- Page 439 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page439"></a>[pg 439]</span> to acknowledge the
  Princess Elizabeth as the lawful heir to the throne; and the question was
  raised whether this offer should be accepted. It was equivalent to a
  demand that the form should be altered, not for them only, but for every
  man. If persons of their rank and notoriety were permitted to swear with
  a qualification, the same privilege must be conceded to all. But there
  was so much anxiety to avoid extremities, and so warm a regard was
  personally felt for Sir Thomas More, that this objection was not allowed
  to be fatal. It was thought that possibly an exception might be made, yet
  kept a secret from the world; and the fact that they had sworn under any
  form might go far to silence objectors and reconcile the better class of
  the disaffected.<a name="NtA_717"></a><a
  href="#Nt_717"><sup>717</sup></a> This view was particularly urged by
  Cranmer, always gentle, hoping, and illogical.<a name="NtA_718"></a><a
  href="#Nt_718"><sup>718</sup></a> But, in fact, secresy was impossible.
  If More's discretion could have been relied upon, Fisher's babbling
  tongue would have trumpeted his victory to all the winds. Nor would the
  government consent to pass censure on its own conduct by evading the
  question whether the act was or was not just. If it was not just, it
  ought not to be: maintained at all; if it was just, there must be no
  respect of persons.</p>

  <p>The clauses to which the bishop and the ex-chancellor declined to bind
  themselves were those which declared illegal the marriage of the king
  with Catherine, and the marriage legal between the king and Queen Anne.
  To refuse these was to declare Mary legitimate, to declare Elizabeth
  illegitimate, and would do more to strengthen Mary's claims than could be
  undone by a thousand oaths. However large might be More's estimate of the
  power of parliament, he could have given no clear answer&mdash;and far
  less could Fisher have given a clear answer&mdash;if they had been
  required to say the part which they would take, should the emperor invade
  the kingdom under the pope's sanction. The emperor would come to execute
  a sentence which in their consciences they believed to be just; how could
  they retain their allegiance to Henry, when their convictions must be
  with the invading army?</p>

  <p>What ought to have been done let those say who disapprove of what was
  actually done. The high character of the prisoners, while it increased
  the desire, increased the difficulty of sparing them; and to have given
  way would have been a confession of a doubtful cause, which at such a
  time would not have been dangerous, but would have been fatal. Anne
  Boleyn is said to <!-- Page 440 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page440"></a>[pg 440]</span> have urged the king to remain
  peremptory;<a name="NtA_719"></a><a href="#Nt_719"><sup>719</sup></a> but
  the following letter of Cromwell's explains the ultimate resolution of
  the council in a very reasonable manner. It was written to Cranmer in
  reply to his arguments for concession.</p>

  <p>"My Lord, after mine humble commendation, it may please your Grace to
  be advertised that I have received your letter, and showed the same to
  the King's Highness; who, perceiving that your mind and opinion is, that
  it were good that the Bishop of Rochester and Master More should be sworn
  to the act of the king's succession, and not to the preamble of the same,
  thinketh that if their oaths should be taken, it were an occasion to all
  men to refuse the whole, or at least the like. For, in case they be sworn
  to the succession, and not to the preamble, it is to be thought that it
  might be taken not only as a confirmation of the Bishop of Rome's
  authority, but also as a reprobation of the king's second marriage.
  Wherefore, to the intent that no such things should be brought into the
  heads of the people, by the example of the said Bishop of Rochester and
  Master More, the King's Highness in no wise willeth but that they shall
  be sworn as well to the preamble as to the act. Wherefore his Grace
  specially trusteth that ye will in no wise attempt to move him to the
  contrary; for as his Grace supposeth, that manner of swearing, if it
  shall be suffered, may be an utter destruction to his whole cause, and
  also to the effect of the law made for the same." <a
  name="NtA_720"></a><a href="#Nt_720"><sup>720</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thus, therefore, with much regret the council decided&mdash;and, in
  fact, why should they have decided otherwise? They were satisfied that
  they were right in requiring the oath; and their duty to the English
  nation obliged them to persevere. They must go their way; and those who
  thought them wrong must go theirs; and the great God would judge between
  them. It was a hard thing to suffer for an opinion; but there are times
  when opinions are as dangerous as acts; and liberty of conscience was a
  plea which could be urged with a bad grace for men who, while in power,
  had fed the stake with heretics. They were summoned for a last time, to
  return the same answer as they had returned before; and nothing remained
  but to pronounce against them the penalties of the statute, imprisonment
  at the king's pleasure, and forfeiture. The latter part of the sentence
  was not enforced. More's family were left in the enjoyment of his
  property. Fisher's bishoprick was not taken <!-- Page 441 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page441"></a>[pg 441]</span> from him. They were
  sent to the Tower, where for the present we leave them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in accordance with the resolution taken in council on the
  and of December,<a name="NtA_721"></a><a
  href="#Nt_721"><sup>721</sup></a> but which seems to have been suspended
  till the issue of the trial at Rome was decided, the bishops, who had
  been examined severally on the nature of the papal authority, and whose
  answers had been embodied in the last act of parliament, were now
  required to instruct the clergy throughout their dioceses&mdash;and the
  clergy in turn to instruct the people&mdash;in the nature of the changes
  which had taken place. A bishop was to preach each Sunday at Paul's
  Cross, on the pope's usurpation. Every secular priest was directed to
  preach on the same subject week after week, in his parish church. Abbots
  and priors were to teach their convents; noblemen and gentlemen their
  families and servants; mayors and aldermen the boroughs. In town and
  country, in all houses, at all dinner-tables, the conduct of the pope and
  the causes of the separation from Rome were to be the one subject of
  conversation; that the whole nation might be informed accurately and
  faithfully of the grounds on which the government had acted. No wiser
  method could have been adopted. The imperial agents would be busy under
  the surface; and the mendicant friars, and all the missionaries of
  insurrection. The machinery of order was set in force to counteract the
  machinery of sedition.</p>

  <p>Further, every bishop, in addition to the oath of allegiance, had
  sworn obedience to the king as Supreme Head of the Church;<a
  name="NtA_722"></a><a href="#Nt_722"><sup>722</sup></a> and this was the
  title under which he was to be spoken of in all churches of the realm. A
  royal order had been issued, "that all manner of prayers, rubrics, canons
  of Mass books, and all other books in the churches wherein the Bishop of
  Rome was named, or his presumptuous and proud pomp and authority
  preferred, should utterly be abolished, eradicated, and rased out, and
  his name and memory should be never more, except to his contumely and
  reproach, remembered; but perpetually be suppressed and obscured."<a
  name="NtA_723"></a><a href="#Nt_723"><sup>723</sup></a></p>

  <p>Nor were these mere idle sounds, like the bellow of unshotted cannon;
  but words with a sharp, prompt meaning, which the king intended to be
  obeyed. He had addressed his orders to the clergy, because the clergy
  were the officials who had possession of the pulpits from which the
  people were to be taught; but he knew their nature too well to trust
  them. They were too <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page442"></a>[pg 442]</span> well schooled in the tricks of
  reservation; and, for the nonce, it was necessary to reverse the posture
  of the priest and of his flock, and to set the honest laymen to overlook
  their pastors.</p>

  <p>With the instructions to the bishops circulars went round to the
  sheriffs of the counties, containing a full account of these
  instructions, and an appeal to their loyalty to see that the royal orders
  were obeyed. "We," the king wrote to them, "seeing, esteeming, and
  reputing you to be of such singular and vehement zeal and affection
  towards the glory of Almighty God, and of so faithful, loving, and
  obedient heart towards us, as you will accomplish, with all power,
  diligence, and labour, whatsoever shall be to the preferment and setting
  forth of God's word, have thought good, not only to signify unto you by
  these our letters, the particulars of the charge given by us to the
  bishops, but also to require and straitly charge you, upon pain of your
  allegiance, and as ye shall avoid our high indignation and displeasure,

  eyes the mirrour of the truth, the glory of God, the dignity of your

  profit and utility, that shall by the due execution of the premises ensue
  to yourselves and to all other faithful and loving subjects, ye make or

  dissimulation, execute and accomplish our will and commandment, as is
  aforesaid. And in case ye shall hear that the said bishops, or any other
  ecclesiastical person, do omit and leave undone any part or parcel of the
  premises, or else in the execution and setting forth of the same, do

  interpretation, or painted colour, then we straitly charge and command
  you that you do make, undelayedly, and with all speed and diligence,

  <p>So Henry spoke at last. There was no place any more for nice
  distinctions and care of tender consciences. The general, when the shot
  is flying, cannot qualify his orders with dainty periods. Swift command
  and swift obedience can alone be tolerated; and martial law for those who
  hesitate.</p>

  <p>This chapter has brought many things to a close. Before ending it we
  will leap over three months, to the termination of the career of the pope
  who has been so far our companion. Not any more was the distracted
  Clement to twist his handkerchief, or weep, or flatter, or wildly wave
  his arms in angry impotence; he was to lie down in his long rest, and vex
  the world no more. He had lived to set England free&mdash;an exploit
  which, in the face of so persevering an anxiety to escape a separation,
  required a rare genius and a combination of singular qualities. He had
  finished his work, and now he was allowed to depart.</p>

  <p>In him, infinite insincerity was accompanied with a grace of manner
  which regained confidence as rapidly as it was forfeited. Desiring
  sincerely, so far as he could be sincere in anything, to please every one
  by turns, and reckless of truth to a degree in which he was without a
  rival in the world, he sought only to escape his difficulties by
  inactivity, and he trusted to provide himself with a refuge against all
  contingencies by waiting upon time. Even when at length he was compelled
  to act, and to act in a distinct direction, his plausibility long enabled
  him to explain away his conduct; and, honest in the excess of his
  dishonesty, he wore his falsehood with so easy a grace that it assumed
  the character of truth. He was false, deceitful, treacherous; yet he had
  the virtue of not pretending to be virtuous. He was a real man, though
  but an indifferent one; and we can refuse to no one, however grave his
  faults, a certain ambiguous sympathy, when in his perplexities he shows
  us features so truly human in their weakness as those of Clement VII.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_21"></a><a href="#NtA_21">21</a> From 1565 to 1575 there
  was a rapid and violent rise in the prices of all kinds of grain. Wheat
  stood at four and five times its earlier rates; and in 1576, when
  Harrison wrote, was entirely beyond the reach of the labouring classes.
  "The poor in some shires," he says, "are enforced to content themselves
  with rye or barley, yea, and in time of dearth many with bread made
  either of peas, beans, or oats, or of all together and some acorns among,
  of which scourge the poorest do soonest taste, sith they are least able
  to provide themselves of better. I will not say that this extremity is
  oft so well seen in time of plenty as of dearth, but if I should I could
  easily bring my trial. For, albeit that there be much more ground eared
  now almost in every place than hath been of late years, yet such a price
  of corn continues in each town and market, that the artificer and poor
  labouring man is not able to reach to it, but is driven to content
  himself with beans, peas, oats, tares, and lentils."&mdash;HARRISON, p.
  283. The condition of the labourer was at this period deteriorating
  rapidly. The causes will be described in the progress of this

  The change in the prices of such articles commenced in the beginning of
  the reign of Edward VI., and continued till the close of the century. A
  discussion upon the subject, written in 1581 by Mr. Edward Stafford, and
  containing the clearest detailed account of the alteration, is printed in
  the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>, vol. ix. p.139, etc.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_24"></a><a href="#NtA_24">24</a> Leland, <i>Itin.</i>,
  vol. vi. p.17. In large households beef used to be salted in great
  quantities for winter consumption. The art of fatting cattle in the stall
  was imperfectly understood, and the loss of substance in the destruction
  of fibre by salt was less than in the falling off of flesh on the failure
  of fresh grass. The Northumberland Household Book describes the storing
  of salted provision for the earl's establishment at Michaelmas; and men
  now living can remember the array of salting tubs in old-fashioned
  country houses. So long as pigs, poultry, and other articles of food,
  however, remained cheap and abundant, the salt diet could not, as Hume
  imagines, have been carried to an extent injurious to health; and fresh
  meat, beef as well as mutton, was undoubtedly sold in all markets the
  whole year round in the reign of Henry VIII., and sold at a uniform
  price, which it could not have been if there had been so much difficulty
  in procuring it. Latimer (<i>Letters</i>, p.412), writing to Cromwell on
  Christmas Eve, 1538, speaks of his winter stock of "beeves" and muttons
  as a thing of course.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_25"></a><a href="#NtA_25">25</a> STAFFORD'S <i>Discourse
  on the State of the Realm</i>. It is to be understood, however, that
  these rates applied only to articles of ordinary consumption. Capons
  fatted for the dinners of the London companies were sometimes provided at
  a shilling apiece. Fresh fish was also extravagantly dear, and when two
  days a week were observed strictly as fasting days, it becomes a curious
  question to know how the supply was kept up. The inland counties were
  dependent entirely on ponds and rivers. London was provided either from
  the Thames or from the coast of Sussex. An officer of the Fishmongers'
  Company resided at each of the Cinque Ports whose business it was to buy
  the fish wholesale from the boats and to forward it on horseback. Three
  hundred horses were kept for this service at Rye alone. And when an
  adventurous fisherman, taking advantage of a fair wind, sailed up the
  Thames with his catch and sold it first hand at London Bridge, the
  innovation was considered dangerous, and the Mayor of Rye petitioned
  against it.</p>

  <p>Salmon, sturgeon, porpoise, roach, dace, flounders, eels, etc., were
  caught in considerable quantities in the Thames, below London Bridge, and
  further up, pike and trout. The fishermen had great nets that stretched
  all across Limehouse-reach four fathoms deep.</p>

  <p>Fresh fish, however, remained the luxury of the rich, and the poor
  were left to the salt cod, ling, and herring brought in annually by the
  Iceland fleet.</p>

  <p>Fresh herrings sold for five or six a penny in the time of Henry
  VIII., and were never cheaper. Fresh salmon five and six shillings
  apiece. Roach, dace, and flounders from two to four shillings a hundred.
  Pike and barbel varied with their length. The barbel a foot long sold for
  five-pence, and twopence was added for each additional inch: a pike a
  foot long sold for sixteen pence, and increased a penny an
  inch.&mdash;<i>Guildhall MSS. Journals</i> 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_26"></a><a href="#NtA_26">26</a> "When the brewer buyeth a
  quarter of malt for two shillings, then he shall sell a gallon of the
  best ale for two farthings; when he buyeth a quarter malt for four
  shillings, the gallon shall be four farthings, and so forth... and that
  he sell a quart of ale upon his table for a farthing."&mdash; Assize of
  Brewers: from a MS. in Balliol College, Oxford.</p>

  <p>By an order of the Lord Mayor and Council of the City of London, in
  September, 1529, the price of a kilderkin of single beer was fixed at a
  shilling, the kilderkin of double beer at two shillings; but this
  included the cask; and the London brewers replied with a remonstrance,
  saying that the casks were often destroyed or made away with, and that an
  allowance had to be made for bad debts. "Your beseechers," they said,
  "have many city debtors, for many of them which have taken much beer into
  their houses suddenly goeth to the sanctuary, some keep their
  houses&mdash;some purchase the king's protection, and some, when they
  die, be reckoned poor, and of no value, and many of your said beseechers
  be for the most part against such debtors remediless and suffer great
  losses."</p>

  <p>They offered to supply then: customers with sixteen gallon casks of
  single beer for eleven pence, and the same quantity of double beer for a
  shilling, the cask included. And this offer was accepted.</p>

  <p>The corporation, however, returned two years after to their original
  order. <i>Guildhall Records</i>, MS. Journal 13, pp. 210, 236.</p>

  <p>The prices assessed, being a maximum, applied to the best wines of
  each class. In 1531, the mayor and corporation "did straitly charge and
  command that all such persons as sold wines by retail within the city and
  liberties of the same, should from henceforth sell two gallons of the
  best red wine for eightpence, and not above; the gallon of the best white
  wine for eightpence, and not above; the pottle, quart, and pint after the
  same rate, upon pain of imprisonment."</p>

  <p>The quality of the wine sold was looked into from time to time, and
  when found tainted, or unwholesome, "according to the antient customs of
  the city," the heads of the vessels were broken up, and the wines in them
  put forth open into the kennels, in example of all other offenders.

  <p><a name="Nt_29"></a><a href="#NtA_29">29</a> See HARRISON, p. 318. At
  the beginning of the century farms let for four pounds a year, which in
  1576 had been raised to forty, fifty, or a hundred. The price of produce
  kept pace with the rent. The large farmers prospered; the poor forfeited
  their tenures.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_30"></a><a href="#NtA_30">30</a> The wages were fixed at a
  maximum, showing that labour was scarce, and that its natural tendency
  was towards a higher rate of remuneration. Persons not possessed of other
  means of subsistence were punishable if they refused to work at the
  statutable rate of payment; and a clause in the act of Hen. VIII.
  directed that where the practice had been to give lower wages, lower
  wages should be taken. This provision was owing to a difference in the
  value of money in different parts of England. The price of bread at
  Stratford, for instance, was permanently twenty-five per cent. below the
  price in London. (Assize of Bread in England: <i>Balliol MS</i>.) The
  statute, therefore, may be taken as a guide sufficiently conclusive as to
  the practical scale. It is of course uncertain how far work was constant.
  The ascending tendency of wages is an evidence, so far as it goes, in the
  labourer's favour; and the proportion between the wages of the household
  farm servant and those of the day labourer, which furnishes a further
  guide, was much the same as at present. By the same statute of Henry
  VIII. the common servant of husbandry, who was boarded and lodged at his
  master's house, received 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year in money, with
  4<i>s.</i> for his clothes; while the wages of the out-door labourer,
  supposing his work constant, would have been £5 a year. Among ourselves,
  on an average of different counties, the labourer's wages are £25 to £30
  a year, supposing his work constant. The farm servant, unless in the
  neighbourhood of large towns, receives about £6, or from that to £8.</p>

  <p>Where meat and drink was allowed it was calculated at 2<i>d.</i> a
  day, or 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> a week. In the household of the Earl of
  Northumberland the allowance was 2½<i>d.</i> Here, again, we observe an
  approach to modern proportions. The estimated cost of the board and
  lodging of a man servant in an English gentleman's family is now about
  £25 a year.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_32"></a><a href="#NtA_32">32</a> In 1581 the agricultural
  labourer, as he now exists, was only beginning to appear. "There be such
  in the realm," says Stafford, "as live only by the labour of their hands
  and the profit which they can make upon the commons."&mdash;STAFFORD'S
  <i>Discourse</i>. This novel class had been called into being by the
  general raising of rents, and the wholesale evictions of the smaller
  tenantry which followed the Reformation. The progress of the causes which
  led to the change can be traced from the beginning of the century.
  Harrison says he knew old men who, comparing things present with things
  past, spoke of two things grown to be very grievous&mdash;to wit, "the
  enhancing of rents, and the daily oppression of copyholders, whose lords
  seek to bring their poor tenants almost into plain servitude and misery,
  daily devising new means, and seeking up all the old, how to cut them
  shorter and shorter; doubling, trebling, and now and then seven times
  increasing their fines; driving them also for every trifle to lose and
  forfeit their tenures, by whom the greatest part of the realm doth stand
  and is maintained, to the end they may fleece them yet more: which is a
  lamentable hearing."&mdash;<i>Description of England</i>, p.318.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_33"></a><a href="#NtA_33">33</a> HALL, p. 581. Nor was the
  act in fact observed even in London itself, or towards workmen employed
  by the Government. In 1538, the Corporation of London, "for certain
  reasonable and necessary considerations," assessed the wages of common
  labourers at 7<i>d.</i> and 8<i>d.</i> the day, classing them with
  carpenters and masons.&mdash;<i>Guildhall MSS. Journal</i> 14, fol. 10.
  Labourers employed on Government works in the reign of Hen. VIII. never
  received less than 6<i>d.</i> a day, and frequently
  more.&mdash;<i>Chronicle of Calais</i>, p. 197, etc. Sixpence a day is
  the usual sum entered as the wages of a day's labour in the innumerable
  lists of accounts in the Record Office. And 6<i>d.</i> a day again was
  the lowest pay of the common soldier, not only on exceptional service in
  the field, but when regularly employed in garrison duty. Those who doubt
  whether this was really the practice, may easily satisfy themselves by
  referring to the accounts of the expenses of Berwick, or of Dover, Deal,
  or Walmer Castles, to be found in the Record Office in great numbers. The
  daily wages of the soldier are among the very best criteria for
  determining the average value of the unskilled labourer's work. No
  government gives higher wages than it is compelled to give by the market
  rate.</p>

  difficulty "peculiar to England, the increase of pasture, by which sheep
  may be now said to devour men and unpeople not only villages but towns.
  For wherever it is found that the sheep yield a softer and richer wool
  than ordinary, there the nobility and gentry, and even those holy men the
  abbots, not contented with the old rents which their farms yielded, nor
  thinking it enough that they, living at their ease, do no good to the
  public, resolve to do it hurt instead of good. They stop the course of
  agriculture.... One shepherd can look after a flock which will stock an
  extent of ground that would require many hands if it were ploughed and
  reaped. And this likewise in many places raises the price of corn. The
  price of wool is also risen ... since, though sheep cannot be called a
  monopoly, because they are not engrossed by one person; yet they are in
  so few hands, and these are so rich, that as they are not prest to sell

  <p><a name="Nt_58"></a><a href="#NtA_58">58</a> It has been objected that
  inasmuch as the Statute Book gives evidence of extensive practices of
  adulteration, the guild system was useless, nay, it has been even said
  that it was the cause of the evil. Cessante causâ cessat
  effectus;&mdash;when the companies lost their authority, the adulteration
  ought to have ceased, which in the face of recent exposures will be
  scarcely maintained. It would be as reasonable to say that the police are
  useless because we have still burglars and pickpockets among us.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_59"></a><a href="#NtA_59">59</a> Throughout the old
  legislation, morality went along with politics and economics, and formed
  the life and spirit of them. The fruiterers in the streets were
  prohibited from selling plums and apples, because the apprentices played
  dice with them for their wares, or because the temptation induced
  children and servants to steal money to buy. When Parliament came to be
  held regularly in London, an order of Council fixed the rates which the
  hotel-keeper might charge for dinners. Messes were served for four at
  twopence per head; the bill of fare providing bread, fish, salt and
  fresh, two courses of meat, ale, with fire and candles. And the care of
  the Government did not cease with their meals, and in an anxiety that
  neither the burgesses nor their servants should be led into sin,
  stringent orders were issued against street-walkers coming near their
  quarters.&mdash;<i>Guildhall MSS. Journals</i> 12 and 15.</p>

  <p>The sanitary regulations for the city are peculiarly interesting. The
  scavengers, constables and officers of the wards were ordered, "on pain
  of death," to see all streets and yards kept clear of dung and rubbish
  and all other filthy and corrupt things. Carts went round every Monday,
  Wednesday, and Saturday, to carry off the litter from the houses, and on
  each of those days twelve buckets of water were drawn for "every person,"
  and used in cleaning their rooms and passages.</p>

  <p>Particular pains were taken to keep the Thames clean, and at the mouth
  of every sewer or watercourse there was a strong iron grating two feet
  deep.&mdash;<i>Guildhall MSS. Journal</i> 15.</p>

  and again that the policy of Henry the Eighth was to make the crown
  despotic by destroying the remnants of the feudal power of the nobility.
  How is such a theory to be reconciled with statutes the only object of
  which was the arming and training of the country population, whose
  natural leaders were the peers, knights, and gentlemen? We have heard too

  <p><a name="Nt_70"></a><a href="#NtA_70">70</a> From my experience of
  modern archery I found difficulty in believing that these figures were
  accurately given. Few living men could send the lightest arrow 220 yards,
  even with the greatest elevation, and for effective use it must be
  delivered nearly point blank. A passage in HOLINSHED'S <i>Description of
  Britain</i>, however, prevents me from doubting that the words of the
  statute are correct. In his own time, he says that the strength of the
  English archers had so notoriously declined that the French soldiers were
  in the habit of disrespectfully turning their backs, at long range,
  "bidding them shoot," whereas, says Holinshed, "had the archers been what
  they were wont to be, these fellows would have had their breeches nailed
  unto their buttocks." In an order for bowstaves, in the reign of Henry
  the Eighth, I find this direction: "Each bowstave ought to be <i>three
  fingers thick</i> and squared, and <i>seven feet long</i>: to be got up
  well polished and without knots."&mdash;Butler to Bullinger: <i>Zurich

  the other by the practice of benefit of clergy. Habit was too strong for
  legislation, and these privileges continued to protect criminals long
  after they were abolished by statute. There is abundant evidence that the

  is no instance in the whole of English history where the ambiguity of the
  marriage law led to a dispute of title. This was not the opinion of those
  who remembered the wars of the fifteenth century. "Recens in quorundam

  rendered his brother's marriage invalid, and Henry VII. tacitly allowed

  VIII. is so clear as to require no additional elucidation; but another

  commission that he should have the emperour his perpetual enemy without
  any hope of reconciliation. Notwithstanding he was content rather to put
  himself in evident ruin, and utter undoing, than the king or your Grace
  shall suspect any point of ingratitude in him; heartily desiring with
  sighs and tears that the king and your Grace which have been always fast
  and good to him, will not now suddenly precipitate him for ever: which
  should be done if immediately on receiving the commission your Grace
  should begin process. He intendeth to save all upright thus. If M. de

  he doth not, at his coming the Pope's Holiness may have good colour to
  say, "He was required of the commission by the ambassador of England, and
  denying the same, he was, eftsoons, required by M. de Lautrec to grant
  the said commission, inasmuch as it was but a letter of justice." And by
  this colour he would cover the matter so that it might appear unto the
  emperour that the pope did it not as he that would gladly do displeasure
  unto the emperour, but as an indifferent judge, that could not nor might
  deny justice, specially being required by such personages; and
  immediately he would despatch a commission bearing date after the time
  that M. de Lautrec had been with him or was nigh unto him. The pope most

  <p><a name="Nt_144"></a><a href="#NtA_144">144</a> Such at least was the
  ultimate conclusion of a curious discussion. When the French herald
  declared war, the English herald accompanied him into the emperor's
  presence, and when his companion had concluded, followed up his words
  with an intimation that unless the French demands were complied with,
  England would unite to enforce them. The Emperor replied to Francis with
  defiance. To the English herald he expressed a hope that peace on that
  side would still be maintained. For the moment the two countries were
  uncertain whether they were at war or not. The Spanish ambassador in
  London did not know, and the court could not tell him. The English
  ambassador in Spain did not leave his post, but he was placed under
  surveillance. An embargo on Spanish and English property was laid
  respectively in the ports of the two kingdoms; and the merchants and
  residents were placed under arrest. Alarmed by the outcry in London, the
  king hastily concluded a truce with the Regent of the Netherlands, the
  language of which implied a state of war; but when peace was concluded
  between France and Spain, England appeared only as a contracting party,
  not as a principal, and in 1542 it was decided that the antecedent
  treaties between England and the empire continued in force.&mdash;See

  Essex, Kent, Wiltshire, Suffolk, and other shires which are clothmaking,
  brought cloths to London to be sold, as they were wont, few merchants or
  none bought any cloth at all. When the clothiers lacked sale, then they
  put from them their spinners, carders, tuckers, and such others that
  lived by clothworking, which caused the people greatly to murmur, and
  specially in Suffolk, for if the Duke of Norfolk had not wisely appeased
  them, no doubt but they had fallen to some rioting. When the king's
  council was advertised of the inconvenience, the cardinal sent for a
  great number of the merchants of London, and to them said, "Sirs, the
  king is informed that you use not yourselves like merchants, but like
  graziers and artificers; for where the clothiers do daily bring cloths to
  the market for your ease, to their great cost, and then be ready to sell
  them, you of your wilfulness will not buy them, as you have been
  accustomed to do. What manner of men be you?" said the cardinal. "I tell
  you that the king straitly commandeth you to buy their cloths as
  beforetime you have been accustomed to do, upon pain of his high
  displeasure."&mdash;HALL, p. 746.</p>

  de repudiandâ dominâ Catherinâ oratio Idibus Novembris habita 1528.</p>

  <p>Veneranda et chara nobis præsulum procerum atque consiliariorum cohors
  quos communis reipublicæ atque regni nostri administrandi cura conjunxit.
  Haud vos latet divinâ nos Providentiâ viginti jam ferme annis hanc
  nostram patriam tantâ felicitate rexisse ut in illâ ab hostilibus
  incursionibus tuta semper interea fuerit et nos in his bellis quæ
  suscepimus victores semper evasimus; et quanquam in eo gloriâri jure
  possumus majorem tranquillitatem opes et honores prioribus huc usque
  ductis socculis, nunquam subditis a majoribus parentibusque nostris
  Angliâ regibus quam a nobis provenisse, tamen quando cum hâc gloriâ in
  mentem una venit ac concurrit mortis cogitatio, veremur ne nobis sine
  prole legitimâ decedentibus majorem ex morte nostrâ patiamini calamitatem
  quam ex vitâ fructum ac emolumentum percepistis. Recens enim in quorundam
  vestrorum animis adhuc est illius cruenti temporis memoria quod a Ricardo
  tertio cum avi nostri materni Edwardi Quarti statum in controversiam
  vocasset ejusque heredes regno atque vitâ privâsset illatum est. Tum ex
  historiis notæ sunt illæ diræ strages quæ a clarissimis Angliæ gentibus
  Eboracensi atque Lancastrensi, dum inter se de regno et imperio multis
  ævis contenderent, populo evenerunt. Ac illæ ex justis nuptiis inter
  Henricum Septimum et dominam Elizabetham clarissimos nostros parentes
  contractis in nobis inde legitimâ natâ sobole sopitæ tandem desierunt. Si
  vero quod absit, regalis ex nostris nuptiis stirps quæ jure deinceps
  regnare possit non nascatur, hoc regnum civilibus atque intestinis se
  versabit tumultibus aut in exterorum dominationem atque potestatem
  veniet. Nam quanquam formâ atque venustate singulari, quæ magno nobis
  solatio fuit filiam Dominam Mariam ex nobilissimâ f&#339;minâ Dominâ
  Catherinâ procreavimus, tamen a piis atque eruditis theologis nuper
  accepimus quia eam quæ Arturi fratris nostri conjux ante fuerat uxorem
  duximus nostras nuptias jure divino esse vetitas, partumque inde editum
  non posse censeri legitimum. Id quod eo vehementius nos angit et
  excruciat, quod cum superiori anno legatos ad conciliandas inter
  Aureliensem ducem et filiam nostram Mariam nuptias ad Franciscum Gallorum
  regem misissemus a quodam ejus consiliario responsum est, "antequam de
  hujusmodi nuptiis agatum inquirendum esse prius an Maria fuerit filia
  nostra legitima; constat enim 'inquit,' quod exdominâ Catherinâ fratris
  sui viduâ cujusmodi nuptiæ jure divino interdictæ sunt suscepta est." Quæ
  oratio quanto metu ac horrore animum nostrum turbaverit quia res ipsa
  æternæ tam animi quam corporis salutis periculum in se continet, et quam
  perplexis cogitationibus conscientiam occupat, vos quibus et capitis aut
  fortunæ ac multo magis animarum jactura immineret, remedium nisi adhibere
  velitis, ignorare non posse arbitror. Hæc una res&mdash;quod Deo teste et
  in Regis oraculo affirmamus&mdash;nos impulit ut per legatos
  doctissimorum per totum orbem Christianum theologorum sententias
  exquireremus et Romani Pontificis legatum verum atque æquum judicium de
  tantâ causâ laturum ut tranquillâ deinceps et intergâ conscientiâ in
  conjugio licito vivere possimus accerseremus. In quo si ex sacris
  litteris hoc quo viginti jam fere annis gavisi sumus matrimonium jure
  divino permissum esse manifeste liquidoque constabit, non modo ob
  conscientiæ tranquillitatem, verum etiam ob amabiles mores virtutesque
  quibus regina prædita et ornata est, nihil optatius nihilque jucundius
  accidere nobis potest. Nam præterquam quod regali atque nobili genere
  prognata est, tantâ præterea comitate et obsequio conjugali tum cæteris
  animi morumque ornamentis quæ nobilitatem illustrant omnes f&#339;minas
  his viginti annis sic mihi anteire visa est ut si a conjugio liber essem
  ac solutus, si jure divino liceret, hanc solam præ cæteris f&#339;minis
  stabili mihi jure ac f&#339;dere matrimoniali conjungerem. Si vero in hoc
  judicio matrimonium nostrum jure divino prohibitum, ideoque ab initio
  nullum irritumque fuisse pronuncietur, infelix hic meus casus multis
  lacrimis lugendus ac deplorandus erit. Non modo quod a tam illustris et
  amabilis mulieris consuetudine et consortio divertendum sit, sed multo
  magis quod specie ad similitudinem veri conjugii decepti in amplexibus
  plusquam fornicariis tam multos annos trivimus nullâ legitimâ prognatâ
  nobis sobole quæ nobis mortuis hujus inclyti regni hereditatem
  capessat.</p>

  <p>Hæ nostræ curæ istæque solicitudines sunt quæ mentem atque
  conscientiam nostram dies noctesque torquent et excurciant, quibus
  auferendis et profligandis remedium ex hâc legatione et judicio
  opportunum quærimus. Ideoque vos quorum virtuti atque fidei multum
  attribuimus rogamus ut certum atque genuinum nostrum de hâc re sensum
  quem ex nostro sermone percepistis populo declaretis: eumque excitetis ut
  nobiscum una oraret ut ad conscientiæ nostræ pacem atque tranquillitatem
  in hoc judicio veritas multis jam annis tenebris involuta tandem
  patefiat.&mdash;WILKINS'S <i>Concilia</i>, vol. iii. p. 714.</p>

  1529,&mdash;"il me semble que Sa Sainteté differe autant qu'il peut ce

  <p>The sort of influence to which the See of Rome was amenable appears in

  <p><a name="Nt_176"></a><a href="#NtA_176">176</a> All authorities agree
  in the early account of Henry, and his letters provide abundant proof
  that it is not exaggerated. The following description of him in the
  despatches of the Venetian ambassador shows the effect which he produced
  on strangers in 1515:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, most serene prince, from what we have seen of him, and in
  conformity, moreover, with the report made to us by others, this most
  serene king is not only very expert in arms and of great valour and most
  excellent in his personal endowments, but is likewise so gifted and
  adorned with mental accomplishments of every sort, that we believe him to
  have few equals in the world. He speaks English, French, Latin,
  understands Italian well; plays almost on every instrument; sings and
  composes fairly; is prudent, and sage, and free from every
  vice."&mdash;<i>Four Years at the Court of Henry VIII.</i> vol. i. p.
  76.</p>

  <p>Four years later, the same writer adds,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The king speaks good French, Latin, and Spanish; is very religious;
  hears three masses a day when he hunts, and sometimes five on other days;
  he hears the office every day in the queen's chamber&mdash;that is to
  say, vespers and complins."&mdash;Ibid. vol. ii. p. 312. William Thomas,
  who must have seen him, says,</p>

  <p>"Of personage he was one of the goodliest men that lived in his time;
  being high of stature, in manner more than a man, and proportionable in
  all his members unto that height; of countenance he was most amiable;
  courteous and benign in gesture unto all persons and specially unto
  strangers; seldom or never offended with anything; and of so constant a
  nature in himself that I believe few can say that ever he changed his
  cheer for any novelty how contrary or sudden so ever it were. Prudent he
  was in council and forecasting; most liberal in rewarding his faithful
  servants, and even unto his enemies, as it behoveth a prince to be. He
  was learned in all sciences, and had the gift of many tongues. He was a
  perfect theologian, a good philosopher, and a strong man at arms, a
  jeweller, a perfect builder as well of fortresses as of pleasant palaces,
  and from one to another there was no necessary kind of knowledge, from a
  king's degree to a carter's, but he had an honest sight in
  it."&mdash;<i>The Pilgrim</i> p. 78.</p>

  <p>"His Majesty has letters from England of the 11th of May, with certain
  news that the paramour of the King of England, who called herself queen,
  has been thrown into the Tower of London for adultery. The partner of her
  guilt was an organist of the Privy Chamber, who is in the Tower as well.
  An officer of the King's wardrobe has been arrested also for the same
  offence with her, and one of her brothers for having been privy to her
  offences without revealing them. They say, too, that if the adultery had
  not been discovered, the King was determined to put her away, having been
  informed by competent witnesses that she was married and had consummated
  her marriage nine years before, with the Earl of Northumberland."</p>

  Priests, he said, both secular and regular, were in the habit of
  committing atrocious crimes, for which, if not in orders, they would have
  been promptly executed; and the laity were scandalised to see such
  persons not only not degraded, but escaping with complete impunity.

  <p>In the first instance the parties accused "made their purgation" and
  were dismissed. The exquisite corruption of the courts, instead of
  inviting evidence and sifting accusations, allowed accused persons to
  support their own pleas of not guilty by producing four witnesses, not to
  disprove the charges, but to swear that they believed the charges untrue.
  This was called "purgation."</p>

  <p>In Scotland the usual mortuary was, a cow and the uppermost cloth or

  reprimanding a suspected clergyman for his leaning toward the
  Reformation, said to him:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My joy, Dean Thomas, I am informed that ye preach the epistle and
  gospel every Sunday to your parishioners, and that ye take not the cow
  nor the upmost cloth from your parishioners; which thing is very
  prejudicial to the churchmen. And therefore, Dean Thomas, I would ye took
  your cow and upmost cloth, or else it is too much to preach every Sunday,
  for in so doing ye may make the people think we should preach
  likewise."&mdash;CALDERWOOD, vol. i. p. 126.</p>

  Christendom, to give way. When the disposition of the court of Rome was
  no longer doubtful, "his difficultatibus permotus, cum in hoc statu res

  <p>Pole, on whose authority we receive these words, says that they were
  heard with almost unanimous satisfaction at the council board. The moment
  of hesitation was, it is almost certain, at the crisis which preceded or

  by the influence of Cromwell, who tempted both the king and parliament
  into their fatal revolt.&mdash;POLI <i>Apologia ad Carolum

  <p>Gardiner has left some noticeable remarks on this subject.</p>

  <p>"Whether," he says, "a king may command against a common law or an act
  of parliament, there is never a judge or other man in the realm ought to
  know more by experience of that the laws have said than I.</p>

  <p>"First, my Lord Cardinal, that obtained his legacy by our late
  Sovereign Lord's requirements at Rome, yet, because it was against the
  laws of the realm, the judges concluded the offence of Premunire, which
  matter I bare away, and took it for a law of the realm, because the
  lawyers said so, but my reason digested it not. The lawyers, for
  confirmation of their doings, brought in the case of Lord Tiptoft. An
  earl he was, and learned in the civil laws, who being chancellor, because
  in execution of the king's commandment he offended the laws of the realm,
  suffered on Tower Hill. They brought in examples of many judges that had
  fines set on their heads in like cases for transgression of laws by the
  king's commandment, and this I learned in that case.</p>

  <p>"Since that time being of the council, when many proclamations were
  devised against the carriers out of corn, when it came to punish the
  offender, the judges would answer it might not be by the law, because the
  Act of Parliament gave liberty, wheat being under a price. Whereupon at
  last followed the Act of Proclamations, in the passing whereof were many
  large words spoken."</p>

  <p>After mentioning other cases, he goes on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I reasoned once in the parliament house, where there was free speech
  without danger, and the Lord Audely, to satisfy me, because I was in some
  secret estimation, as he knew, 'Thou art a good fellow, Bishop,' quoth
  he; 'look at the Act of Supremacy, and there the king's doings be
  restrained to spiritual jurisdiction; and in another act no spiritual law
  shall have place contrary to a common law, or an act of parliament. And
  this were not,' quoth he, 'you bishops would enter in with the king, and
  by means of his supremacy order the laws as ye listed. But we will
  provide,' quoth he, 'that the premunire shall never go off your heads.'
  This I bare away then, and held my peace."&mdash;Gardiner to the
  Protector Somerset: <i>MS. Harleian</i>, 417.</p>

  what good might come of reading of the New Testament and following the
  same; and what evil might come of the reading of the same if it were evil
  translated, and not followed; came into the Star Chamber the
  five-and-twentieth day of May; and then communed with his council and the
  prelates concerning the cause. And after long debating, it was alleged
  that the translations of Tyndal and Joy were not truly translated, and
  also that in them were prologues and prefaces that sounded unto heresy,
  and railed against the bishops uncharitably. Wherefore all such books
  were prohibited, and commandment given by the king to the bishops, that
  they, calling to them the best learned men of the universities, should
  cause a new translation to be made, so that the people should not be

  petition, the official transcriber having contented himself with the
  substance, and omitted the date. The original, as appears from the pope's
  reply (LORD HERBERT, p. 145), bore the date of July 13; and unless a
  mistake was made in transcribing the papal brief, this was July, 1530. I
  have ventured to assume a mistake, and to place the petition in the
  following year, because the judgment of the universities, to which it
  refers, was not completed till the winter of 1530; they were not read in
  parliament till March 30, 1531; and it seems unlikely that a petition of
  so great moment would have been presented on an incomplete case, or
  before the additional support of the House of Commons had been secured. I
  am far from satisfied, however, that I am right in making the change. The
  petition must have been drawn up (though it need not have been presented)
  in 1530; since it bears the signature of Wolsey, who died in the November
  of that year.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_365"></a><a href="#NtA_365">365</a> It has been thought
  that the Tudor princes and their ministers carried out the spy system to
  an iniquitous extent,&mdash;that it was the great instrument of their
  Machiavellian policy, introduced by Cromwell, and afterwards developed by
  Cecil and Walsingham. That both Cromwell and Walsingham availed
  themselves of secret information, is unquestionable,&mdash;as I think it
  is also unquestionable that they would have betrayed the interests of
  their country if they had neglected to do so. Nothing, in fact, except
  their skill in fighting treason with its own weapons, saved England from
  a repetition of the wars of the Roses, envenomed with the additional fury
  of religious fanaticism. But the agents of Cromwell, at least, were all
  volunteers;&mdash;their services were rather checked than encouraged; and
  when I am told, by high authority, that in those times an accusation was
  equivalent to a sentence of death, I am compelled to lay so sweeping a
  charge of injustice by the side of a document which forces me to demur to
  it. "In the reign of the Tudors," says a very eminent writer, "the
  committal, arraignment, conviction, and execution of any state prisoner,
  accused or <i>suspected, or under suspicion of being suspected</i> of
  high treason, were only the regular terms in the series of judicial
  proceedings." This is scarcely to be reconciled with the 10th of the 37th
  of Hen. VIII., which shows no desire to welcome accusations, or
  exaggerated readiness to listen to them.</p>

  <p>"Whereas," says that Act, "divers malicious and evil disposed persons
  of their perverse, cruel, and malicious intents, minding the utter
  undoing of some persons to whom they have and do bear malice, hatred, and
  evil will, have of late most devilishly practised and devised divers
  writings, wherein hath been comprised that the same persons to whom they
  bear malice should speak traitorous words against the King's Majesty, his
  crown and dignity, or commit divers heinous and detestable treasons
  against the King's Highness, where, in very deed, the persons so accused
  never spake nor committed any such offence; by reason whereof divers of
  the king's true, faithful, and loving subjects have been put in fear and
  dread of their lives and of the loss and forfeiture of their lands and
  chattels&mdash;for reformation hereof, be it enacted, that if any person
  or persons, of what estate, degree, or condition he or they shall be,
  shall at any time hereafter devise, make, or write, or cause to be made
  any manner of writing comprising that any person has spoken, committed,
  or done any offence or offences which now by the laws of this realm be
  made treason, or that hereafter shall be made treason, and do not
  subscribe, or cause to be subscribed, his true name to the said writing,
  and within twelve days next after ensuing do not personally come before
  the king or his council, and affirm the contents of the said writings to
  be true, and do as much as in him shall be for the approvement of the
  same, that then all and every person or persons offending as aforesaid,
  shall be deemed and adjudged a felon or felons; and being lawfully

  the only men that have and do take upon themselves to be conveyers of the
  same books into England, and conveyers of all other things into and out
  of England. If privy search be made, and shortly, peradventure in the
  house of the same bishop shall be found his first copy. Master More hath
  sent oftentimes and lately books unto Peto, in Antwerp&mdash;as his book
  of the confutation of Tyndal, and of Frith's opinion of the sacrament,
  with divers other books. I can no further learn of More's practices, but
  if you consider this well, you may perchance espy his craft. Peto
  laboureth busylier than a bee in the setting forth of this book. He never
  ceaseth running to and from the court here. The king never had in his

  <p><i>The Cardinal of Lorraine to Cardinal &mdash;&mdash; at
  Rome.</i></p>

  <p>"Paris, Jan. 8, 1531-2.</p>

  <p>"RIGHT REVEREND FATHER AND LORD IN CHRIST.&mdash;After our most humble
  commendations&mdash;The King of England complains loudly that his cause
  is not remanded into his own country; he says that it cannot be equitably
  dealt with at Rome, where he cannot be present. He himself, the Queen,
  and the other witnesses, are not to be dragged into Italy to give their
  evidence; and the suits of the Sovereigns of England and France have
  always hitherto been determined in their respective countries.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, by no entreaty can we prevail on the Pope to nominate
  impartial judges who will decide the question in England.</p>

  <p>"The King's personal indignation is not the only evil which has to be
  feared. When these proceedings are known among the people, there will,
  perhaps, be a revolt, and the Apostolic See may receive an injury which
  will not afterwards be easily remedied.</p>

  <p>"I have explained these things more at length to his Holiness, as my
  duty requires. Your affection towards him, my lord, I am assured is no
  less than mine. I beseech you, therefore, use your best endeavours with
  his Holiness, that the King of England may no longer have occasion to
  exclaim against him. In so doing you will gratify the Most Christian
  King, and you will follow the course most honourable to yourself and most
  favourable to the quiet of Christendom.</p>

  <p>"From Abbeville."</p>

  <p><i>Francis the First to Pope Clement the Seventh.</i></p>

  <p>"Paris, Jan. 10, 1531-2.</p>

  <p>"MOST HOLY FATHER,&mdash;You are not ignorant what our good brother
  and ally the King of England demands at your hands. He requires that the
  cognisance of his marriage be remanded to his own realm, and that he be
  no further pressed to pursue the process at Rome. The place is
  inconvenient from its distance, and there are other good and reasonable
  objections which he assures us that he has urged upon your Holiness's
  consideration.</p>

  <p>"Most Holy Father, we have written several times to you, especially of
  late from St. Cloud, and afterwards from Chantilly, in our good brother's
  behalf; and we have further entreated you, through our ambassador
  residing at your Court, to put an end to this business as nearly
  according to the wishes of our said good brother as is compatible with
  the honour of Almighty God. We have made this request of you as well for
  the affection and close alliance which exist between ourselves and our
  brother, as for the filial love and duty with which we both in common
  regard your Holiness.</p>

  <p>"Seeing, nevertheless, Most Holy Father, that the affair in question
  is still far from settlement, and knowing our good brother to be
  displeased and dissatisfied, we fear that some great scandal and
  inconvenience may arise at last which may cause the diminution of your
  Holiness's authority. There is no longer that ready obedience to the Holy
  See in England which was offered to your predecessors; and yet your
  Holiness persists in citing my good brother the King of England to plead
  his cause before you in Rome. Surely it is not without cause that he
  calls such treatment of him unreasonable. We have ourselves examined into
  the law in this matter, and we are assured that your Holiness's claim is
  unjust and contrary to the privilege of kings. For a sovereign to leave
  his realm and plead as a suitor in Rome, is a thing wholly impossible,<a
  name="NtA_377"></a><a href="#Nt_377"><sup>377</sup></a> and therefore,
  Holy Father, we have thought good to address you once more in this
  matter. Bear with us, we entreat you. Consider our words, and recall to
  your memory what by letter and through our ministers we have urged upon
  you. Look promptly to our brother's matter, and so act that your Holiness
  may be seen to value and esteem our friendship. What you do for him, or
  what you do against him, we shall take it as done to ourselves.</p>

  <p>"Holy Father, we will pray the Son of God to pardon and long preserve
  your Holiness to rule and govern our Holy Mother the
  Church.&mdash;FRANCIS."</p>

  <p>"HIGH AND MIGHTY LORD,&mdash;Although your Majesty is occupied with
  your own affairs and with your preparations against the Turk, I cannot,
  nevertheless, refrain from troubling you with mine, which perhaps in
  substance and in the sight of God are of equal importance. Your Majesty
  knows well, that God hears those who do him service, and no greater
  service can be done than to procure an end in this business. It does not
  concern only ourselves&mdash;it concerns equally all who fear God. None
  can measure the woes which will fall on Christendom, if his Holiness will
  not act in it and act promptly. The signs are all around us in new
  printed books full of lies and dishonesty&mdash;in the resolution to
  proceed with the cause here in England&mdash;in the interview of these
  two princes, where the king, my lord, is covering himself with infamy
  through the companion which he takes with him. The country is full of
  terror and scandal; and evil may be looked for if nothing be done, and
  inasmuch as our only hope is in God's mercy, and in the favour of your
  Majesty, for the discharge of my conscience, I must let you know the
  strait in which I am placed.</p>

  <p>"I implore your Highness for the service of God, that you urge his
  Holiness to be prompt in bringing the cause to a conclusion. The longer
  the delay the harder the remedy will be.</p>

  <p>"The particulars of what is passing here are so shocking, so
  outrageous against Almighty God, they touch so nearly the honour of my
  Lord and husband, that for the love I bear him, and for the good that I
  desire for him, I would not have your Highness know of them from me. Your
  ambassador will inform you of all."&mdash;Queen Catherine to Charles V.
  September 18.&mdash;MS. Simancas.</p>

  <p>The Emperor, who was at Mantua, was disturbed at the meeting at
  Boulogne, on political grounds as well as personal. On the 24th of
  October he wrote to his sister, at Brussels.</p>

  <p><i>Charles the Fifth to the Regent Mary.</i></p>

  <p>Mantua, October 16, 1532.</p>

  <p>I found your packets on arriving here, with the ambassadors' letters
  from France and England. The ambassadors will themselves have informed
  you of the intended conference of the Kings. The results will make
  themselves felt ere long. We must be on our guard, and I highly approve
  of your precautions for the protection of the frontiers.</p>

  <p>As to the report that the King of England means to take the
  opportunity of the meeting to marry Anne Boleyn, I can hardly believe
  that he will be so blind as to do so, or that the King of France will
  lend himself to the other's sensuality. At all events, however, I have
  written to my ministers at Rome, and I have instructed them to lay a
  complaint before the Pope, that, while the process is yet pending, in
  contempt of the authority of the Church, the King of England is
  scandalously bringing over the said Anne with him, as if she were his
  wife.</p>

  <p>His Holiness and the Apostolic See will be the more inclined to do us
  justice, and to provide as the case shall require.</p>

  <p>Should the King indeed venture the marriage&mdash;as I cannot think he
  will&mdash;I have desired his Holiness not only not to sanction such
  conduct openly, but not to pass it by in silence. I have demanded that
  severe and fitting sentence be passed at once on an act so wicked and so
  derogatory to the Apostolic See.&mdash;<i>The Pilgrim</i>, p. 89.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_386"></a><a href="#NtA_386">386</a> There can be little
  doubt of this. He was the child of the only intrigue of Henry VIII. of
  which any credible evidence exists. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of
  Sir John Blunt, an accomplished and most interesting person; and the
  offspring of the connection, one boy only, was brought up with the care
  and the state of a prince. Henry FitzRoy, as he was called, was born in
  1519, and when six years old was created Earl of Nottingham and Duke of
  Richmond and Somerset, the title of the king's father.</p>

  <p>In 1527, before the commencement of the disturbance on the divorce,
  Henry endeavoured to negotiate a marriage for him with a princess of the
  imperial blood; and in the first overtures gave an intimation which could
  not be mistaken, of his intention, if possible, to place him in the line
  of the succession. After speaking of the desire which was felt by the
  King of England for some connection in marriage of the Houses of England
  and Spain, the ambassadors charged with the negotiation were to say to
  Charles, that&mdash;</p>

  <p>"His Highness can be content to bestow the Duke of Richmond and
  Somerset (who is near of his blood, and of excellent qualities, and is
  already furnished to keep the state of a great prince, <i>and yet may be
  easily by the king's means exalted to higher things</i>) to some noble
  princess of his near blood."&mdash;ELLIS, third series, vol. ii. p.
  121.</p>

  <p>He was a gallant, high-spirited boy. A letter is extant from him to
  Wolsey, written when he was nine years old, begging the cardinal to
  intercede with the king, "for an harness to exercise myself in arms
  according to my erudition in the Commentaries of Cæsar."&mdash;Ibid. p.
  119.</p>

  <p>He was brought up with Lord Surrey, who has left a beautiful account
  of their boyhood at Windsor&mdash;their tournaments, their hunts, their
  young loves, and passionate friendship. Richmond married Surrey's sister,

  <p>The intention was really perhaps what the nun said. An agent of the
  government at Brussels, who was watching the conference, reported on the
  12th of November:&mdash;"The King of England did really cross with the
  intention of marrying; but, happily for the emperor, the ceremony is
  postponed. Of other secrets, my informant has learned thus much. They
  have resolved to demand as the portion of the Queen of France, Artois,
  Tournay, and part of Burgundy. They have also sent two cardinals to Rome
  to require the Pope to relinquish the tenths, which they have begun to
  levy for themselves. If his Holiness refuse, the King of England will
  simply appropriate them throughout his dominions. Captain &mdash;&mdash;
  heard this from the king's proctor at Rome, who has been with him at
  Calais, and from an Italian named Jeronymo, whom the Lady Anne has
  roughly handled for managing her business badly. She trusted that she
  would have been married in September.</p>

  <p>"The proctor told her the Pope delayed sentence for fear of the
  Emperor. The two kings, when they heard this, despatched the cardinals to
  quicken his movements; and the demand for the tenths is thought to have
  been invented to frighten him.</p>

  <p>"They are afraid that the Emperor may force his Holiness into giving
  sentence before the cardinals arrive. Jeronymo has been therefore sent
  forward by post to give him notice of their approach, and to require him
  to make no decision till they have spoken with him."&mdash;<i>The

  originally the king's (see chapter 2), but it had been dropped because
  one of the conditions of it had been Catherine's "entrance into
  religion." The pope, however, had not lost sight of the alternative, as
  one of which, in case of extremity, he might avail himself; and, in 1530,
  in a short interval of relaxation, he had definitely offered the king a
  dispensation to have two wives, at the instigation, curiously, of the
  imperialists. The following letter was written on that occasion to the
  king by Sir Gregory Cassalis:&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_398"></a><a href="#NtA_398">398</a> The obtaining the
  opinion in writing of the late Cardinal of Ancona, and submitting it to
  the emperor. This minister, the most aged as well as the most influential
  member of the conclave, had latterly been supposed to be inclined to
  advise a conciliatory policy towards England; and his judgment was of so
  much weight that it was thought likely that the emperor would have been
  unable to resist the publication of it, if it was given against him. At
  the critical moment of the Bologna interview this cardinal unfortunately
  died: he had left his sentiments, however, in the hands of his nephew,
  the Cardinal of Ravenna, who, knowing the value of his legacy, was
  disposed to make a market of it. It was a knavish piece of business. The
  English ambassadors offered 3000 ducats; Charles bid them out of the
  field with a promise of church benefices to the extent of 6000 ducats; he
  did not know precisely the terms of the judgment, or even on which side
  it inclined, but in either case the purchase was of equal importance to
  him, either to produce it or to suppress it. The French and English
  ambassadors then combined, and bid again with church benefices in the two
  countries, of equal value with those offered by Charles, with a promise
  of the next English bishopric which fell vacant, and the original 3000
  ducats as an initiatory fee. There was a difficulty in the transaction,
  for the cardinal would not part with the paper till he had received the
  ducats, and the ambassadors would not pay the ducats till they had
  possession of the paper. The Italian, however, proved an overmatch for
  his antagonists. He got his money, and the judgment was not produced
  after all.&mdash;<i>State Papers</i>, vol. vii. pp. 397-8, 464. BURNET,

  although it is a difficult and delicate matter to decide how far

  <p><a name="Nt_412"></a><a href="#NtA_412">412</a> Francis represented
  himself to Henry as having refused with a species of bravado. "He told
  me," says Sir John Wallop, "that he had announced previously that he
  would consent to no such interview, unless your Highness were also
  comprised in the same; and if it were so condescended that your Highness
  and he should be then together, yet you two should go after such a sort
  and with such power that you would not care whether the pope and emperor
  would have peace or else <i>coups de baston</i>."&mdash;Wallop to Henry,
  from Paris, Feb. 22. But this was scarcely a complete account of the
  transaction; it was an account only of so much of it as the French king
  was pleased to communicate. The emperor was urgent for a council. The
  pope, feeling the difficulty either of excluding or admitting the
  Protestant representatives, was afraid of consenting to it, and equally
  afraid of refusing. The meeting proposed to Francis was for the
  discussion of this difficulty; and Francis, in return, proposed that the
  great Powers, Henry included, should hold an interview, and arrange
  beforehand the conclusions at which the council should arrive. This naïve
  suggestion was waived by Charles, apparently on grounds of religion. LORD
  HERBERT, Kennet's Edit. p. 167.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_413"></a><a href="#NtA_413">413</a> The emperor's answer
  touching this interview is come, and is, in effect, that if the pope
  shall judge the said interview to be for the wealth and quietness of
  Christendom, he will not be seen to dissuade his Holiness from the same;
  but he desired him to remember what he showed to his Holiness when he was
  with the same, at what time his Holiness offered himself for the
  commonwealth to go to any place to speak with the French
  king.&mdash;Bennet to Henry VIII.; <i>State Papers</i>, vol. vii. p.

  infernal machine introduced by Francis into Paris for the better
  correction of heresy. The offender was slung by a chain over a fire, and
  by means of a crane was dipped up and down into the flame, the torture
  being thus prolonged for an indefinite time. Francis was occasionally
  present in person at these exhibitions, the executioner waiting his
  arrival before commencing the spectacle.</p>

  as Warham's successor; and had been consecrated on the 30th of March,
  1533. On the occasion of the ceremony when the usual oath to the Pope was
  presented to him, he took it with a declaration that his first duty and
  first obedience was to the crown and laws of his own country. It is idle
  trifling, to build up, as too many writers have attempted to do, a charge
  of insincerity upon an action which was forced upon him by the existing
  relation between England and Rome. The Act of Appeals was the law of the
  land. The separation from communion with the papacy was a contingency
  which there was still a hope might be avoided. Such a protest as Cranmer
  made was therefore the easiest solution of the difficulty. See it in

  complexion: <i>come seinte Eglise estoit founde en estat de prelacie

  countes, barons, et nobles de ce Royaulme et lours ancestres, pour eux et
  le poeple enfourmer de la lei Dieu.</i> If the Church of England was held
  to have been, founded not by the successors of the Apostles, but by the
  king and the nobles, the claim of Henry VIII. to the supremacy was
  precisely in the spirit of the constitution.</p>

  Ric. II. cap. 3; 12 Ric. II. cap. 15; 13 Ric. II. stat. 2. The first of
  these acts contains a paragraph which shifts the blame from the popes
  themselves to the officials of the Roman courts. The statute is said to
  have been enacted en eide et confort du pape qui moult sovent a estee
  trublez par tieles et semblables clamours et impetracions, et qui y meist
  voluntiers covenable remedie, si sa seyntetee estoit sur ces choses
  enfournee. I had regarded this passage as a fiction of courtesy like that
  of the Long Parliament who levied troops in the name of Charles I. The
  suspicious omission of the clause, however, in the translation of the
  statutes which was made in the later years of Henry VIII. justifies an
  interpretation more favourable to the intentions of the popes.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_476"></a><a href="#NtA_476">476</a> There is no better
  test of the popular opinion of a man than the character assigned to him
  on the stage; and till the close of the sixteenth century Sir John
  Oldcastle remained the profligate buffoon of English comedy. Whether in
  life he bore the character so assigned to him, I am unable to say. The
  popularity of Henry V., and the splendour of his French wars, served no
  doubt to colour all who had opposed him with a blacker shade than they
  deserved: but it is almost certain that Shakspeare, though not intending
  Falstaff as a portrait of Oldcastle, thought of him as he was designing
  the character; and it is altogether certain that by the London public
  Falstaff was supposed to represent Oldcastle. We can hardly suppose that
  such an expression as "my old lad of the castle," should be accidental;
  and in the epilogue to the Second Part of <i>Henry the Fourth</i>, when
  promising to reintroduce Falstaff once more, Shakspeare says, "where for
  anything I know he shall die of the sweat, for Oldcastle died a martyr,
  and this is not the man." He had, therefore, certainly been supposed to
  <i>be the man</i>, and Falstaff represented the English conception of the
  character of the Lollard hero. I should add, however, that Dean Milman,
  who has examined the records which remain to throw light on the character
  of this remarkable person with elaborate care and ability, concludes
  emphatically in his favour.</p>

  them, "never would they be subject to his laws nor to man's, but would be

  <p>"Please your Highness to understand that I am certainly informed as I
  passed in this country, that an Englishman, your subject, at the
  solicitation and instance of Luther, with whom he is, hath translated the
  New Testament into English; and within few days intendeth to return with
  the same imprinted into England. I need not to advertise your Grace what
  infection and danger may ensue hereby if it be not withstanded. This is
  the next way to fulfil your realm with Lutherians. For all Luther's
  perverse opinions be grounded upon bare words of Scripture, not well
  taken, ne understanded, which your Grace hath opened in sundry places of
  your royal book. All our forefathers, governors of the Church of England,
  hath with all diligence forbid and eschewed publication of English
  Bibles, as appeareth in constitutions provincial of the Church of
  England. Nowe, sure, as God hath endued your Grace with Christian courage
  to sett forth the standard against these Philistines and to vanquish
  them, so I doubt not but that he will assist your Grace to prosecute and
  perform the same&mdash;that is, to undertread them that they shall not
  now lift up their heads; which they endeavour by means of English Bibles.
  They know what hurt such books hath done in your realm in times
  past."&mdash;Edward Lee to Henry VIII.: ELLIS, third series, vol. ii. p.

  <p>"In right humble manner I commend me unto your good Lordship, doing
  the same to understand that I lately received your letters, dated at your
  manor of Lambeth, the 26th day of the month of May, by the which I do
  perceive that your Grace hath lately gotten into your hands all the books

  And when, in your said letters, ye write that, insomuch as this matter
  and the danger thereof, if remedy had not been provided, should not only
  have touched you, but all the bishops within your province; and that it
  is no reason that the holle charge and cost thereof should rest only in
  you; but that they and every of them, for their part, should advance and
  contribute certain sums of money towards the same: I for my part will be
  contented to advance in this behalf, and to make payment thereof unto
  your servant, Master William Potkyn.</p>

  <p>"Pleaseth it you to understand, I am well contented to give and
  advance in this behalf ten marks, and shall cause the same to be
  delivered shortly; the which sum I think sufficient for my part, if every
  bishop within your province make like contribution, after the rate and
  substance of their benefices. Nevertheless, if your Grace think this sum
  not sufficient for my part in this matter, your further pleasure known, I
  shall be as glad to conform myself thereunto in this, or any other matter
  concerning the church, as any your subject within your province; as knows
  Almighty God, who long preserve you. At Hoxne in Suffolk, the 14th day of

  of what he considers their recklessness. It seems obvious, however, that
  a falsehood of this kind is something different in kind from what we
  commonly mean by unveracity, and has no affinity with it. I do not see my
  way to a conclusion; but I am satisfied that Dr. Maitland's strictures
  are unjust. If Garret was taken, he was in danger of a cruel death, and
  his escape could only be made possible by throwing the bloodhounds off
  the scent. A refusal to answer would not have been sufficient; and the
  general laws by which our conduct is ordinarily to be directed, cannot be
  made so universal in their application as to meet all contingencies. It
  is a law that we may not strike or kill other men, but occasions rise in
  which we may innocently do both. I may kill a man in defence of my own
  life or my friend's life, or even of my friend's property; and surely the
  circumstances which dispense with obedience to one law may dispense
  equally with obedience to another. <i>If</i> I may kill a man to prevent
  him from robbing my friend, why may I not deceive a man to save my friend
  from being barbarously murdered? It is possible that the highest morality
  would forbid me to do either. I am unable to see why, if the first be
  permissible, the second should be a crime. Rahab of Jericho did the same
  thing which Dalaber did, and on that very ground was placed in the
  catalogue of saints.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_544"></a><a href="#NtA_544">544</a> The circumstances are
  curious. Philips begged that he might have the benefit of the king's writ
  of corpus cum causâ, and be brought to the bar of the House of Commons,
  where the Bishop of London should be subp&#339;naed to meet him.
  [Petition of Thomas Philips: <i>Rolls House MS.</i>] The Commons did not
  venture on so strong a measure; but a digest of the petition was sent to
  the Upper House, that the bishop might have an opportunity of reply. The
  Lords refused to receive or consider the case: they replied that it was
  too "frivolous an affair" for so grave an assembly, and that they could
  not discuss it. [<i>Lords' Journals</i>, vol. i. p. 66.] A deputation of
  the Commons then waited privately upon the bishop, and being of course
  anxious to ascertain whether Philips had given a true version of what had
  passed, they begged him to give some written explanation of his conduct,
  which might be read in the Commons' House. [<i>Lords' Journals</i>, vol.
  i. p. 71.] The request was reasonable, and we cannot doubt that, if
  explanation had been possible, the bishop would not have failed to offer
  it; but he preferred to shield himself behind the judgment of the Lords.
  The Lords, he said, had decided that the matter was too frivolous for
  their own consideration; and without their permission, he might not set a
  precedent of responsibility to the Commons by answering their
  questions.</p>

  <p>This conduct met with the unanimous approval of the Peers. [<i>Lords'
  Journals</i>, vol. i. p. 71. Omnes proceres tam spirituales quam
  temporales unâ, voce dicebant, quod non consentaneum fuit aliquem
  procerum prædictorum alicui in eo loco responsurum.] The demand for
  explanation was treated as a breach of privilege, and the bishop was
  allowed to remain silent. But the time was passed for conduct of this
  kind to be allowed to triumph. If the bishop could not or would not
  justify himself, his victim might at least be released from unjust
  imprisonment. The case was referred to the king: and by the king and the
  House of Commons Philips was set at liberty.</p>

  <p>"I was once called to one of my kinsfolk," he says ("it was at that
  time when I had taken my degree at Cambridge); I was called, I say, to
  one of my kinsfolk which was very sick, and died immediately after my
  coming. Now, there was an old cousin of mine, which, after the man was
  dead, gave me a wax candle in my hand, and commanded me to make certain
  crosses over him that was dead; for she thought the devil should run away
  by and bye. Now, I took the candle, but I could not cross him as she
  would have me to do; for I had never seen it before. She, perceiving I
  could not do it, with great anger took the candle out of my hand, saying,
  'It is pity that thy father spendeth so much money upon thee;' and so she
  took the candle, and crossed and blessed him; so that he was sure
  enough."&mdash;LATIMER'S <i>Sermons</i>, p. 499.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_587"></a><a href="#NtA_587">587</a> Are we to believe
  Foxe's story that Cromwell was with the Duke of Bourbon at the storming
  of Rome in May, 1527? See FOXE, vol. v. p. 365. He was with Wolsey in
  January, 1527. See ELLIS, third series, vol. ii. p. 117. And he was again
  with him early in 1528. Is it likely that he was in Italy on such an
  occasion in the interval? Foxe speaks of it as one of the random exploits
  of Cromwell's youth, which is obviously untrue; and the natural
  impression which we gather is, that he was confusing the expedition of
  the Duke of Bourbon with some earlier campaign. On the other hand Foxe's
  authority was Cranmer, who was likely to know the truth; and it is not
  impossible that, in the critical state of Italian politics, the English
  government might have desired to have some confidential agent in the Duke
  of Bourbon's camp. Cromwell, with his knowledge of Italy and Italian, and
  his adventurous ability, was a likely man to have been sent on such an
  employment; and the story gains additional probability from another
  legend about him, that he once saved the life of Sir John Russell, in
  some secret affair at Bologna. See FOXE, vol. v. p. 367. Now, although
  Sir John Russell had been in Italy several times before (he was at the
  Battle of Pavia, and had been employed in various diplomatic missions),
  and Cromwell might thus have rendered him the service in question on an
  earlier occasion, yet he certainly was in the Papal States, on a most
  secret and dangerous mission, in the months preceding the capture of
  Rome. <i>State Papers</i>, vol. vi. p. 560, etc. The probabilities may

  of the highest importance to avoid any illegality of form. Cranmer, by
  transgressing the inhibition which Clement had issued in the winter,
  might be construed by the papal party to have virtually incurred the
  censures threatened, and an escape might thus have been furnished from
  the difficulty in which the appeal placed them.</p>

  20. The pre-existing, unrealities with respect to the election of bishops
  explain the unreality of the new arrangement, and divest it of the
  character of wanton tyranny with which it appeared <i>primâ facie</i> to
  press upon the Chapters. The history of this statute is curious, and
  perhaps explains the intentions with which it was originally passed. It
  was repealed by the 2nd of the 1st of Edward VI. on the ground that the
  liberty of election was merely nominal, and that the Chapters ought to be
  relieved of responsibility when they had no power of choice. Direct
  nomination by the crown was substituted for the <i>congé d'élire</i>, and
  remained the practice till the reaction under Mary, when the indefinite
  system was resumed which had existed before the Reformation. On the
  accession of Elizabeth, the statute of 25 Henry VIII. was again enacted.
  The more complicated process of Henry was preferred to the more simple
  one of Edward, and we are naturally led to ask the reason of so singular
  a preference. I cannot but think that it was this. The Council of Regency
  under Edward VI. treated the Church as an institution of the State, while
  Henry and Elizabeth endeavoured (under difficulties) to regard it under
  its more Catholic aspect of an organic body. So long as the Reformation
  was in progress, it was necessary to prevent the intrusion upon the bench
  of bishops of Romanising tendencies, and the deans and chapters were
  therefore protected by a strong hand from their own possible mistakes.
  But the form of liberty was conceded to them, not, I hope, to place
  deliberately a body of clergymen in a degrading position, but in the
  belief that at no distant time the Church might be allowed without danger
  to resume some degree of self-government.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_698"></a><a href="#NtA_698">698</a> In a tract written by
  a Dr. Moryson in defence of the government, three years later, I find
  evidence that a distinction was made among the prisoners, and that Dr.
  Bocking was executed with peculiar cruelty. "Solus in crucem actus est
  Bockingus," are Moryson's words, though I feel uncertain of the nature of
  the punishment which he meant to designate. "Crucifixion" was unknown to
  the English law; and an event so peculiar as the "crucifixion" of a monk
  would hardly have escaped the notice of the contemporary chroniclers. In
  a careful diary kept by a London merchant during these years, which is in
  MS. in the Library of Balliol College, Oxford, the whole party are said
  to have been hanged.&mdash;See, however, <i>Morysini Apomaxis</i>,

  "against the usurped power of the Bishop of Rome." We trace it in its
  progress through the House of Lords. (<i>Lords' Journals</i>, Parliament
  of 1533-4.) It received the royal assent (ibid.), and is subsequently
  alluded to in the both of the 28th of Henry VIII., as well as in a Royal
  Proclamation dated June, 1534; and yet it is not on the Roll, nor do I
  anywhere find traces of it. It is not to be confounded with the act
  against payment of Peter's Pence, for in the <i>Lords' Journals</i> the
  two acts are separately mentioned. It received the royal assent on the
  30th of March, while that against Peter's Pence was suspended till the
  7th of April. It contained, also, an indirect assertion that the king was
  Head of the English Church, according to the title which had been given
  him by Convocation. (King's Proclamation: FOXE, vol. v. p. 69.) For some
  cause or other, the act at the last moment must have been withdrawn.</p>

  promised that if the pope would delay sentence, and send "judges to hear
  the matter, he would himself forbear to do what he proposed to
  do"&mdash;that is, separate wholly from the See of Rome. If this is true,
  the sending "judges" must allude to the "sending them to Cambray," which

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
